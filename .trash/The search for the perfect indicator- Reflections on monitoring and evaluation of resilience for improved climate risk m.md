\
Consider two communities in very different situations. Community A suffers from minor droughts because it has minimal water storage potential and is completely reliant on rainfall for farming. Farmers in this community cultivate crops that can survive drought, but have low productivity. As a result, poverty is widespread in community A. Community B is richer and uses irrigation massively, applying groundwater pumping to provide the water, which leads to rapid salinization of the water reserves and creates a threat to longer-term water supply for agriculture and human consumption. Here, the question is whether universal resilience indicators can capture the nuance that community A can become more resilient due to investments in irrigation and move toward more water-intensive crops, while community B can become more resilient due to dis-investment in irrigation and a move to less water-intensive agriculture. Similar issues will arise with adaptive social safety nets, which may either make a community sustainable and resilient by facilitating coping during a bad year, or in other situations may keep people in locations where they have no credible long-term prospects, pathways to prosperity, and decent living conditions

1\) designed to **account for climate risks **and other uncertainties and are flexible enough in their implementation and monitoring and evaluation (M& E) system to be able to adjust as climate risks ensue\
2\) support resilience building **outcomes **in a given community, ecosystem, or country. \
\
Both could require that a range of climate models are used to stress test the project and identify the most appropriate activity or investment – **based on strict procedural norms **regarding how these different climate model outputs are taken into account to reach a robust decision.
