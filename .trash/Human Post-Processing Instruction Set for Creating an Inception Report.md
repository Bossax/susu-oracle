### Purpose

Finalize and format the AI-generated draft into a **publication-ready inception report** aligned with UNDP and government expectations.

### 1. Document Formatting and Layout

Human editor must:

- Add title page (project title, RFP no., authors, date, submission details).
    
- Insert table of contents, lists of tables and figures, and acronyms list.
    
- Apply UNDP numbering convention (e.g., Chapter 1, 1.1, 1.2...).
    
- Insert consistent headers, footers, and pagination.
    

### 2. Tables and Figures

- Create tables for **Workplan** (tasks × calendar months) and **Deliverables** (No., Title, Description, Due Date, Review Body).
    
- Add or import figures (architecture diagrams, dashboards, validation flowcharts).
    
- Cross-reference tables and figures in text.
    

### 3. Content Validation

- Cross-check task and deliverable descriptions against the TOR and contract.
    
- Align all timelines and deliverable dates with the signed agreement.
    
- Verify that each listed deliverable exists in the contract schedule.
    

### 4. Institutional and Stylistic Adjustment

- Replace generic text with **agency-standard phrasing** (e.g., “endorsed by the Steering Committee,” “subject to validation by DCCE”).
    
- Balance tone for government documentation—neutral, precise, and procedural.
    

### 5. QA and Governance Detailing

- Insert the actual QA and validation flow (draft review → national workshop → incorporation → sign-off).
    
- Identify responsible agencies or individuals for each QA step.
    
- Include version control table (date, revision no., description, approved by).
    

### 6. Visual Coherence

- Harmonize figure styles, table formatting, and caption numbering.
    
- Ensure all appendices are labeled (Appendix A, B, C...).
    
- Maintain consistency between figures, references, and text mentions.
    

### 7. Reference and Citation Management

- Standardize bibliography per UNDP or client guidelines.
    
- Reinsert footnotes or references dropped during AI conversion.
    

### 8. Final Review and Sign-off

Perform a comprehensive check:

- All required sections and annexes present.
    
- Table and figure lists accurate.
    
- QA and risk sections clearly written.
    
- Funder-facing language formal and confirmatory.
    
- Metadata (dates, project code, submission details) verified.
