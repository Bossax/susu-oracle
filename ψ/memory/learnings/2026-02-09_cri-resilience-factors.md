# Lesson Learned: The Resilience Reality Gap

**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Source**: rrr: DCCE-CRI
**Context**: Researching Hat Yai flood resilience vs theoretical frameworks.

## Observation
There is a consistent divergence between "Governance-Oriented" resilience frameworks (which measure the existence of plans and bodies) and "Process-Based" realities (how recovery actually happens). In the Hat Yai case study, theoretical resilience factors often failed to predict the actual bottlenecks in recovery.

## Insight
Resilience is not a static attribute that can be fully captured by an index of assets or policies. It is a dynamic property that emerges during the crisis. Therefore, any "Climate Risk Index" (CRI) we develop must include **stress-test metrics**—indicators that measure how systems behave under pressure, not just how they look on paper.

## Application
- **Action**: When designing the DCCE-CRI data model, prioritize "flux" metrics (rate of response, resource mobilization speed) over "stock" metrics (budget size, number of staff) where possible.
