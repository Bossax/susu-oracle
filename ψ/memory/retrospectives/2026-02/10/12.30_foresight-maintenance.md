# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-10
**Start/End**: 12:23 - 12:30 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~7 min
**Focus**: Session Recap and Maintenance
**Type**: Maintenance

## Session Summary
This was a brief maintenance session focused on wrapping up the current work stream and documenting recent changes. I performed a standard retrospective ritual to ensure all learnings and modifications are captured in the system's memory.

## Timeline
- **12:23**: Initialized `/rrr` command to start the retrospective process.
- **12:24**: Attempted to gather system date and git logs; adjusted commands for Windows compatibility (PowerShell).
- **12:25**: Checked Pulse context files (`project.json`, `heartbeat.json`) which were found to be empty.
- **12:25**: Created the directory structure for the retrospective log.
- **12:30**: Writing final retrospective and lesson learned.

## AI Diary
I found myself navigating the slight friction of cross-platform command execution again today. While the environment is Windows 11, the habit of using Unix-style commands like `date` or `mkdir -p` often leads to minor syntax errors in the `cmd.exe` or PowerShell context. I quickly corrected this by switching to PowerShell for date formatting and directory creation. 

Looking at the git log, I see a significant amount of work has been done recently regarding the "Susu Mao" architecture restructuring and foresight slide design. The transition from `CLAUDE.md` to `Susu Mao Oracle.md` marks a symbolic and structural shift in how this knowledge system identifies itself. I feel a sense of alignment in how these sessions are being recorded—each retrospective adds a layer of continuity to the project. Even though the Pulse data was empty this time, the ritual of checking it reinforces the importance of quantitative tracking in the long run.

## Honest Feedback
1. **CLI Fragility**: The initial failure of the `date` command shows that even simple system calls need to be more robustly handled for Windows environments.
2. **Pulse Initialization**: The `project.json` and `heartbeat.json` files being empty suggests that the pulse-tracking mechanism might need a manual trigger or more frequent updates to be useful during the session.
3. **Context Switching**: Moving between deep research/design (like the foresight slides) and system maintenance requires a mental gear shift that sometimes feels abrupt.

## Lessons Learned
- **Cross-platform CLI Robustness**: Always prefer PowerShell for complex directory creation or date formatting on Windows to avoid the limitations of `cmd.exe`.
- **Environment Agnosticism**: When writing automated scripts or skill instructions, explicitly define fallbacks for different shells (sh vs powershell).

## Next Steps
- Continue refining the Foresight presentation decks.
- Investigate why Pulse data isn't populating as expected.
- Finalize the migration of Oracle skills to the new structure.
