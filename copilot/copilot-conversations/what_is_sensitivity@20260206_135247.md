**user**: what is sensitivity
[Timestamp: 2026/02/06 13:52:47]

**ai**: Based on the provided context, sensitivity is a component used to determine vulnerability, alongside adaptive capacity [^1].

The relationship is defined by the function:

$Vulnerability \approx f(Sensitivity, Adaptive Capacity)$

Sensitivity is described as a positive function of potential damage, meaning that higher sensitivity leads to higher vulnerability. In data modeling, it is considered an attribute of a system that mediates the impact of a hazard [^1].
