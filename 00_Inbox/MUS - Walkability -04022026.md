# The Democracy of the Sidewalk and the Fishbone City

**A Deep Dive into Urban Mobility, Systemic Dead Ends, and the Governance of the Step**

**Reading Time:** ~35 Minutes

### Introduction: The Efficiency of the CEO

The lecture hall is often a place of idealism, where sustainability is the default religion and the car is the devil. But in this session on urban mobility, the lecturer—Apiwat—begins by playing the devil’s advocate, and he plays it with relish. He opens not with the virtues of the pedestrian or the moral superiority of the bicycle, but with the cold, hard logic of 20th-century capitalism.

"How would you argue that cars are more valuable than walking?" he demands, leaning over the podium.

It is a trap, of course, but one grounded in the realities of traditional transportation planning. For decades, the metric of success for city engineers has been speed. In the calculus of the World Bank and national highway departments, speed is productivity. If a CEO, whose time is theoretically worth thousands of dollars an hour, sits in a private Mercedes, and a street vendor walks on the pavement, traditional economic models favor the CEO.

"We need to let him move faster," the lecturer posits, mimicking the rationale that paved over the canals of Bangkok and the tramlines of Los Angeles. "Because his one minute is more economically productive than somebody else walking for one minute."

This is the **"Time Savings Bias"** that ruled urban planning from 1950 to 2000. It posits that the primary function of a city is to reduce the friction of distance for high-value economic actors. The result? We built cities for the "safety" of the driver, insulating them in steel boxes, even if that box made the world less safe—and less economically vibrant—for everyone outside of it. We prioritized the _flow_ of the artery over the _life_ of the capillary.

But the tide is turning. The lecture pivots from the "productivity" of the car to the "necessity" of the walk, moving from the high-speed highways of theory to the uneven, dog-plagued sidewalks of Bangkok. The argument is no longer just about moving people; it is about keeping the city, and its citizens, alive.

### Part I: The Bio-Political Shift

_From Traffic Engineering to Public Health_

If the car was the engine of the 20th century, the sidewalk is the engine of the 21st—but the argument has shifted from "convenience" to "survival."

The lecturer introduces a stark modern doctrine: **"Sitting is the new smoking."**

This is not merely a slogan; it is a shift in the bio-politics of urban planning. In the 20th century, the great killers were infectious diseases and wars. In the 21st, we die from our lifestyles—Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) like stroke, heart disease, and diabetes. The sedentary nature of the auto-centric city is a slow-motion public health crisis.

"Human are born to walk," the lecturer quotes a colleague. "Other things are just the extension... don't think of walking as the fringe."

This re-frames the sidewalk. It is no longer just a strip of concrete for those who cannot afford a car; it is the gymnasium of the masses. A city that forces you to drive to buy a carton of milk is a city that is actively shortening your life expectancy.

#### The Economics of Vitality: The Siam Square Experiment

To illustrate the economic power of the pedestrian, the lecturer invokes the history of **Siam Square**. Fifteen years ago, this retail district was dying. The rise of online shopping was cannibalizing physical retail; the necessity of the shop was fading. Why go out when the product can come to you?

Then came a radical shift: pedestrianization. The removal of cars and the integration with mass transit (BTS) roared the area back to life.

Why? **"Foot traffic,"** the lecturer explains. Walking contributes to the "vitality" of the street in a way a car never can. A driver is a destination shopper—they go from Point A to Point B, ignoring everything in between. A walker is an impulse shopper; they flow past the ground floor, they smell the food, they see the sale. The sidewalk is the funnel of commerce. This realization has begun to reshape architecture; malls now attempt to blur the line between the public sidewalk and their private frontage to siphon that pedestrian energy inside.

#### The Ghost of the Scala

However, this vitality came at a steep cultural cost, a detail the lecturer ensures we do not miss. He points to the demolition of the **Scala Theatre**.

The Scala was the last of Bangkok’s great standalone movie palaces—a beautiful, Art Deco modernist structure that anchored the identity of Siam Square. But in the eyes of the developer, it was an inefficient use of "prime floor area ratio (FAR)." It was torn down to be replaced by a retail block that maximizes the very foot traffic the lecturer praises.

This serves as a grim counter-weight to the economic success story. The "resurrection of the street" often buries the history that was there before. We have traded the "soul" of the cinema for the "flow" of the consumer. It raises a difficult question for the class: Do we want a walkable city if the only things left to walk to are chain stores?

### Part II: The Democratic Pavement
_Theory and The Failed Utopia of Separation_

Beyond economics and health, the lecture touches on the political philosophy of the pavement. Walking is described as the **"most democratic form of mobility."**

In a car, status is signaled instantly—the make, the model, the license plate, the presence of a chauffeur. The road is a hierarchy of metal. On the sidewalk, while shoes may hint at wealth, we are physically equal. We occupy the same volume of space. "A rich person can still get hit by a car," the lecturer notes darkly. There is a shared vulnerability and a shared energy in walking that acts as a social leveler.

#### The "Radburn" Failure: Tama New Town

If cars are dangerous and walking is virtuous, why not separate them entirely? This was the logic of the **Radburn Principle**, a 1929 planning theory from New Jersey that sought to build the "Town for the Motor Age" by completely segregating pedestrians from effective traffic.

The lecturer recounts the application of this theory in **Tama New Town**, a massive development in Tokyo built in the 1960s and 70s. The planners, driven by safety concerns, created two completely separate networks: roads for cars on one level or periphery, and winding pathways for pedestrians through parks on another.

On paper, it was a utopia of safety. In reality, it created a **disorientation of place**. Children growing up in Tama lacked a "sense of direction" because the roads and the paths never met. The environment was sterile. It turns out that the **friction of the street**—the visible connection between the road, the sidewalk, and the building—is necessary for a coherent cognitive map of the city.

This is the **Jane Jacobs factor**: a safe street is not an empty street, but a street full of eyes. By hiding pedestrians away in park paths, Tama New Town removed the "eyes on the street," making the public spaces feel desolate and, paradoxically, less safe than a busy, mixed-use road.

### Part III: The Bangkok Labyrinth

_Anatomy of the Fishbone City_

The discussion inevitably lands in Bangkok, a city that defies standard urban planning theories. Here, the challenge to walkability is not just the dominance of the car, but the geometry of the city itself.

The lecturer describes Bangkok’s street network as a **"Fishbone" pattern**.
- **The Spine:** The main arterial roads (Sukhumvit, Silom, Phahon Yothin).
- **The Bones:** The _sois_ (alleys) that branch off.
- **The Flaw:** The bones do not connect.
    

In a functional grid city (like Barcelona or New York), if one street is blocked, you turn right, go down a block, and turn left. You flow around the obstacle. In Bangkok, the _sois_ are dead ends. To get from Soi 3 to Soi 5—often visible just over a fence—one must retreat all the way out to the main spine, brave the traffic, and dive back in.

This is a crisis of hierarchy. A functioning city has highways, arterial roads, **distributor roads**, and local streets. Bangkok misses the middle tier—the "distributor roads" that connect neighborhoods internally. This forces local traffic (grandma going to the market) onto major arteries (container trucks going to the port), clogging the system and making walking illogical. A 100-meter shortcut becomes a 2-kilometer trek.

#### Urban Hiking and the Cat Poop Factor
The class pivots to the "lived experience" of walking in this fishbone city. It is not a stroll; it is an extreme sport. "It’s like Urban Hiking," the lecturer jokes.

In Tokyo or London, pedestrians walk looking straight ahead, scanning the horizon. In Bangkok, the gaze is permanently downward—scanning for uneven tiles, holes, motorcycle taxis riding on the pavement, and the omnipresent **"dog poop."** The pedestrian is in a constant state of vigilance, not against crime, but against the infrastructure itself.

This prompts a discussion on safety that goes beyond lighting. It is about **transparency**. High walls around condominiums and private estates create dead zones. "If you have a wall... once somebody goes inside, other people outside cannot see," the lecturer explains. Paradoxically, the open lawns of American suburbs or the visible shop-houses of old Bangkok feel safer than the fortified compounds of the modern city because visibility creates security.

### Part IV: The Privilege of the Shortcut

_Private Property vs. Public Access_
If the streets are dead ends, how do people actually move? They cheat. The lecturer engages the students in a confession session: "Where have you done shortcuts?"

Students admit to jumping fences at the Faculty of Pharmacy or sneaking through parking lots. But the lecturer highlights a specific, glossy example: **EmQuartier**.

EmQuartier is a luxury mall that connects the Phrom Phong BTS station to the deeper _sois_ behind it. Thousands of pedestrians use it not to shop, but as a shortcut—an air-conditioned, marble-floored bridge to bypass the hostility of the street grid.

This reveals a **"privatization of the walk."** To move comfortably in Bangkok, you often have to enter private property, relying on the benevolence of a developer rather than the right of a citizen. If the mall closes, the neighborhood is cut off.

This is a legal bottleneck. The lecturer contrasts this with:
- **Sweden:** The "Right to Roam" allows walking across private land.
- **US/UK:** The concept of "easements" preserves historical pathways.
- **Thailand:** Private property is absolute.
    
A developer builds a condo, blocks a traditional path that villagers have used for 50 years, and the connection is severed forever. The lecturer suggests that the only time to fix this is _before_ the building permit is issued—a moment for planners to negotiate public access as a condition of development. Once the concrete dries, the wall stays up.

### Part V: The Shadow Infrastructure

_The "Win" Driver as Government_
While the West debates the regulation of electric scooters, Bangkok has already solved the "Last Mile" problem, but it didn't use technology. It used the **Motorcycle Win** (taxi).

The lecturer identifies the "Win" not just as a service, but as an organic market response to the "fishbone" failure. Because the government refused to build distributor roads (the small capillaries connecting the arteries), the market provided the motorcycle taxi to thread the needle.

But the "Win" is more than transport; it is **Shadow Infrastructure**.
1. **Surveillance:** The Win drivers at the top of the _soi_ know everyone who comes in and out. They are the eyes on the street.
2. **Logistics:** Long before Uber Eats, Win drivers were delivering food and documents.
3. **Mobility:** They are the only reason the deep _sois_ of Bangkok are habitable without a private car.
    

**The Chicken and Egg of Public Bicycles** The lecturer contrasts the success of the Win with the failure of public bicycles. Should the government subsidize a bike-share system?

The class debates the cost (theft, vandalism). But the lecturer cuts to the core: We view bicycles as "recreation," not "transit." We are willing to subsidize a bus or a train (which loses money), but we demand a bicycle system make a profit. "It’s a Chicken and Egg problem," he argues. Without government support to signal that _this is mass transit_, the system remains a hobbyist niche. A bicycle sharing system is functionally no different from a bus service—it moves the public and requires subsidy to survive.

### Part VI: Governance and the Future

_From Horse Manure to Electric Dreams_
The lecture concludes with a profound look at **Governance**—the invisible software that runs the hardware of the city.

He contrasts three models of traffic culture:

1. **The US Model (Rights-Based):** Rigid enforcement. If a car doesn't stop, you sue. Pedestrians have "rights," sometimes aggressively so. (He recalls a woman in Brookline yelling at a car even when she was technically in the wrong).
2. **The Sicily/Bangkok Model (Negotiation-Based):** Traffic lights are suggestions. The intersection is governed by eye contact, nudging, and non-verbal norms. It is chaotic, but functional.
3. **The Japan Paradox (The Double Illegal):** Japan is safe, yet strictly regulated. A student mentions a friend in Japan who rode a bicycle on the sidewalk (illegal) and hit an elderly person. He broke two laws simultaneously. "As long as you don't hit anybody, it's legal. But the moment you hit somebody, it's double illegal," the lecturer observes.
    

**The Dubai Irony: The Cycle of Solutions** To close, the lecturer offers a history lesson that upends the "cars are evil" narrative, referencing an exhibit he saw at the **Guggenheim in Dubai**.

In the 1910s, the car was hailed as the _environmental savior_ of the city. Why? Because the alternative was the **horse**. New York and London were drowning in manure. The city stank; it was a biological hazard. The automobile was the "clean" technology that eliminated the waste of the horse.

"History is interesting," the lecturer muses. The solution of one century (the car) becomes the crisis of the next (emissions). And it is fitting to learn this lesson in Dubai—a city built on oil, now hosting museums reflecting on the end of the oil age.

As the class ends, the lecturer sets the stage for the next battleground, perhaps the most contentious of all in urban planning, the one place where the "rights" of the car and the human clash most violently:

**"Next week is Parking! My ultimate enemy."**
