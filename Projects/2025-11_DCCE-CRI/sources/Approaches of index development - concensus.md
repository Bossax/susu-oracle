## **Adaptive Capacity in Risk Indices:** Evidence shows heavy reliance on static “stocks,” frequent conflation with coping, and weak treatment of transformation, agency, and governance.

### 1. The “Stock vs. Process” Critique

Reviews show that many climate risk and resilience indices operationalize **adaptive capacity** through **static, stock‑type indicators**:

- Early and many contemporary studies use the **Sustainable Livelihoods / five‑capitals** model (income, education, infrastructure, natural resources, etc.) as proxies for adaptive capacity, especially at national and sectoral scale (Chapagain et al., 2025; Siders, 2019; Vallury et al., 2022; Abdul-Razak & Kruse, 2017; Williges et al., 2017).
- Higher‑level assessments commonly aggregate national data such as **GDP, Gini coefficient, food production, infrastructure, and literacy** as adaptive capacity determinants (Siders, 2019; Vallury et al., 2022; Williges et al., 2017).
- Top‑down indices (e.g., national or municipal resilience indices) also use per capita GDP, infrastructure density, and similar socio‑economic stocks as core capacity indicators (Vallury et al., 2022; Williges et al., 2017; Parsons et al., 2016; Marzi et al., 2019).

The literature explicitly critiques this **stock‑centric** operationalization:

- Adaptive capacity has been “predominantly centered on asset‑based analyses” and the SLF “may not be sufficient,” because it **overlooks crucial components beyond the asset base** and fails to capture the **willingness and ability to transform resources into action** (Chapagain et al., 2025).
- Systematic reviews find **generic capital indicators** (income, education) are poor predictors of actual adaptation behaviour compared with more process‑related indicators such as risk perception, experience, and motivation (Schubert et al., 2025).
- At higher societal levels, simply aggregating household‑level capital indicators “oversimplifies and ignores cross‑level interactions” and governance processes that actually shape adaptive capacity (Vallury et al., 2022).

These critiques support the view that many indices are measuring **wealth and generic coping potential**, not the **dynamic process of adaptation**.

### 2. Conflation of Adaptive and Coping Capacity

There is direct evidence that **coping and adaptive capacity are merged or blurred** in quantitative work:

- Integrated assessment modelling work explicitly constructs a **single five‑capitals index** and notes that, for very aggregate applications, **“the same indicators can be used to simulate adaptive and coping capacity”** (Tinch et al., 2015). This is a deliberate methodological conflation of conceptually distinct capacities.
- A review of community resilience measurement shows a “profound lack of clarity” leading to **confusion about adaptive capacity, resilience, and vulnerability** despite intensive operationalization efforts (Mochizuki et al., 2018).
- Many urban resilience tools emphasize **coping and incremental adaptation capacities** and are criticized for triggering **short‑term fixes rather than long‑term transformations** (Mehryar et al., 2022; Laurien et al., 2022).
- Conceptual syntheses stress that adaptive capacity has evolved from “coping capacity” linguistically and conceptually, and that empirical studies often still **use asset/capital‑based proxies that are equally applicable to coping** (Chapagain et al., 2025; Mochizuki et al., 2018; Siders, 2019; Tinch et al., 2015).

Empirical studies further show that these capacity indices do **not reliably predict adaptation**:

- Surveys of businesses and households find that **severity of impact** or specific psychosocial factors, not generic capital‑based “adaptive capacity,” drive actual adaptation and coping actions (Bartelet et al., 2023; Schubert et al., 2025).
- This “capacity–action gap” is interpreted partly as a **mismatch between the theoretical definition of adaptive capacity and the indicators used**, which largely capture generic resources more relevant to short‑term coping than to long‑term system change (Bartelet et al., 2023; Schubert et al., 2025).

Overall, the literature supports the hypothesis that **quantitative CRAs and indices often conflate adaptive with coping capacity**, even when theory distinguishes them.

### 3. The “Missing Middle” of Transformative Capacity

Evidence suggests **transformative capacity** is **rarely operationalized** in standard indices:

- A review of 27 urban climate resilience tools finds a “prevailing focus on coping and incremental adaptation capacities (as opposed to transformative capacities),” and argues that tools largely **fail to measure the enabling environment for transformation** (Mehryar et al., 2022).
- A critical review of resilience measurement approaches similarly concludes that current tools need to better integrate **process‑based perspectives** and systemic change, implying that transformative aspects remain weakly represented (Laurien et al., 2022).
- The Australian Natural Disaster Resilience Index is presented as unusual precisely because it **includes adaptive capacity explicitly**; even there, transformability is discussed conceptually but not turned into a separate, quantified “transformative capacity” metric (Parsons et al., 2016).
- A multi‑hazard framework for coping, adaptive, and transformative capacity notes that these are **latent and difficult to measure**, and that most existing indices address only coping/absorptive and incremental adaptive changes (Mochizuki et al., 2018; Turchi et al., 2023).

Barriers to operationalizing transformative capacity include:

- **Data constraints**: governance quality, power shifts, innovation, and social mobilization are not routinely measured and require time‑consuming qualitative methods (Vallury et al., 2022; Laurien et al., 2022; Turchi et al., 2023).
- **Conceptual ambiguity and lack of standard indicators**: systematic reviews of transformative or transformative resilience highlight the **absence of standardized metrics** and the dominance of adaptive capacity proxies instead (Mochizuki et al., 2018; Laurien et al., 2022; Sofyan et al., 2025).
- **Policy demand for simple, comparable numbers**, favouring stock‑based, cross‑sectional data over complex, longitudinal process indicators (Siders, 2019; Vallury et al., 2022; Laurien et al., 2022; Williges et al., 2017; Marzi et al., 2019).

This supports the claim that the “middle” of **transformative capacity** is largely **missing or only qualitatively treated** in mainstream CRA and resilience indices.

### 4. Agency, Governance, and Power: Intrinsic Trait vs. Capability

Multiple reviews argue that current indicators **under‑represent agency, power, and decision‑making quality**:

- Systematic reviews emphasize that adaptive capacity should include **agency, governance, knowledge, innovation and institutions**, but note that most quantitative work still focuses on **assets and structural stocks** (Chapagain et al., 2025; Siders, 2019; Vallury et al., 2022).
- At societal levels, governance attributes such as **collaboration, accountability, learning, and networks** are identified as critical but are rarely included because these data are **not readily available or statistically convenient**, leading researchers back to easier stock indicators (Vallury et al., 2022).
- Household‑level conceptual work argues that existing assessments treat households as **discrete units** with given capacities, instead of embedding them in **risk governance contexts**, power relations, and cross‑scalar trade‑offs (Elrick-Barr et al., 2014).
- Newer frameworks explicitly introduce concepts like **“institutional adaptive capacity”** and **“reflexive capacity”** to foreground how power structures and participation shape whether capacity stocks are actually mobilized (Fila et al., 2024).
- Empirical work on the capacity–action gap finds that **psychosocial factors (risk perception, motivation)** and institutional trust, not just wealth or education, determine whether people act, highlighting the role of **agency and governance** (Bartelet et al., 2023; Schubert et al., 2025).

Several authors therefore criticize that adaptive capacity is operationalized as an **intrinsic trait—“what they have”**—rather than as an **agent‑based capability—“what they can and do decide to do”** under given governance constraints (Chapagain et al., 2025; Siders, 2019; Vallury et al., 2022; Elrick-Barr et al., 2014; Fila et al., 2024). This reinforces its conflation with generic coping potential and limits its value for understanding long‑term, transformative adaptation.
