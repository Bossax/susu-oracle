# Sectoral adaptation concept
The study researches key adaptation concepts for each sectors, contrasting benefits and downsides, applicability to Thailand's context and giving case studies from other 
countries.

# Area-specific adaptation guidelines
- focus group interview with local stakeholders mostly gov agencies
- summarize the interview results into adaptation guidelines for sectors and the chosen areas
- Guidelines are structured based on adaptation typology
	- infrastructure 
	- policy
	- data
	- finance
	- landscape
	- scale
		- individual
		- community
		- city


# CRI literature review

for methodology, go to [[Climate Risk Index (CRI) Pilot Methodology]]

The research study reviewed a comprehensive list of international and national indices related to climate risk and vulnerability. This review was conducted as part of the work focusing on studying the **Climate Risk Index (CRI)** to develop a suitable methodology for Thailand.

The indices reviewed are categorized as follows:

## International Climate and Environmental Indices  

The study reviewed several major international indices used to assess climate change performance and risk globally:

1. **Global Climate Risk Index (Global CRI):** Developed by Germanwatch, this index assesses the risk from extreme weather events, focusing on impacts to human lives and the economy based on historical data. The project specifically adopted and adjusted the framework of the CRI 2025 by Germanwatch for application in Thailand.
2. **World Risk Index (WRI):** This index evaluates disaster risk at the national level by considering both exposure to natural hazards and the social vulnerability of a country, including its coping and adaptive capacities.
3. **Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI):** This index evaluates and ranks countries based on their policies and performance in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting renewable energy, managing energy use, and implementing climate policy, aligning with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
4. **Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI):** This term refers to several similar indices:
    - The CVI developed by the **Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN)** assesses a country's vulnerability to climate change impacts and its readiness (or capacity) to adapt.
    - The CVI developed by the **Asian Development Bank (ADB)**, which measures vulnerability primarily in the Asia-Pacific region across physical, economic, and social dimensions.
5. **Environmental Performance Index (EPI):** Developed by Yale and Columbia Universities, the EPI measures and compares environmental performance based on achieving environmental goals, including climate change mitigation, environmental health, and ecosystem vitality.
6. **Investment Migration Climate Resilience Index:** This index evaluates the ability of countries to cope with climate change for the purpose of identifying investment migration options, considering factors like climate risk, environmental infrastructure, and economic resilience.
7. **Environmental Emergency Risk Index (EERI):** This index assesses the risk of environmental emergencies, including natural disasters and industrial pollution, and the area's response capacity.
8. **Disaster Risk Index (DRI):** Developed by UNDRR, this index evaluates and manages disaster risk, often calculated as Risk = Hazard $\times$ Vulnerability $\div$ Capacity.

## Country-Specific/Local Indices Reviewed (ระดับประเทศ)

The project also examined indices and assessment frameworks used in other countries and Thailand for local relevance:

1. **U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA):** A U.S. report assessing the impacts of climate change nationally and regionally.
2. **UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (UKCCRA):** A U.K. tool to evaluate long-term climate risks across society, the economy, and the environment.
3. **Japan Climate Resilience Policy Indicator:** An indicator assessing Japan's preparedness, capacity, and effectiveness in managing climate change and adaptation planning.
4. **Urban Climate Resilience Index** (Japan): Measures the ability of Japanese cities to cope with, adapt to, and recover from climate change impacts like flooding and heatwaves.
5. **Climate Resilience Index-Melbourne** (Australia): Evaluates the climate resilience of various neighborhoods in Melbourne based on factors like amenities, transport, biodiversity, and hazard resilience.

### Thai-Specific Indices Reviewed

1. **การประเมินความเสี่ยงด้านสภาพภูมิอากาศในระดับจังหวัด** (Provincial-level Climate Risk Assessment): Conducted by the Department of Climate Change and Environment (DCCE), this uses spatial databases and indicators across environmental, economic, and social dimensions.
2. **ดัชนีชี้วัดความเปราะบางต่อความแปรปรวนสภาพภูมิอากาศ** (Vulnerability indicator index to climate variability, specific to agriculture/Eastern Thailand).
3. **การควบรวมดัชนีความเปราะบางทางสังคมจากการเปลี่ยนแปลงสภาพภูมิอากาศเข้าสู่การวางแผนการใช้ประโยชน์ที่ดิน** (Integration of social vulnerability index into land use planning, focused on Bangkok and surrounding areas).

### The Index Developed by the Project

Based on this comprehensive review, the project focused its efforts on developing a locally relevant measure:

1. **ดัชนีความเสี่ยงด้านการเปลี่ยนแปลงสภาพอากาศ (Climate Risk Index: CRI) สำหรับประเทศไทย** (Climate Risk Index for Thailand).
2. This index is designed to assess damage and severity caused by extreme weather events (hydrological, meteorological, and climatological) at the **provincial level**.
3. It specifically adapts the Germanwatch CRI framework by incorporating eight sub-variables over short-term (1 year) and long-term (10 years) periods, including impacts on human lives and the economy, with a special emphasis on **agricultural damage**.
