## Tag: overview

“The National Risk Index is intended to help users better understand the natural hazard risk of their communities. Intended users include planners and emergency managers at the local, regional, state, and federal levels, as well as other decision makers and interested members of the general public.” (FEMA, p. 32)

“it can support decision making to: ▪ Update emergency operations plans ▪ Enhance hazard mitigation plans ▪ Prioritize and allocate resources ▪ Identify the need for more refined risk assessments ▪ Encourage community-level risk communication and engagement ▪ Educate homeowners and renters ▪ Support enhanced codes and standards ▪ Inform long-term community recovery” (FEMA, p. 32)

“the Methodology is unique and carefully constructed to meet the specific needs of natural hazard risk assessment at both small and large geographic scales.” (FEMA, p. 38)

## Tag: Risk assessment

“County-level risk is subsequently calculated by summing values across Census tracts contained within a given county’s footprint. This means that only Census tract level SVI values enter the risk calculation” (FEMA, p. 47) County's community risk factor is aggregated from census tract's, not from county data collection , although county's level SVI is provided

## Tag: definition

“historic loss ratio (HLR)” (FEMA, p. 45)

“annualized frequency” (FEMA, p. 55) Annualized frequency can be calculated as the number of historical occurrences of a natural hazard within a known period of record per geographic area using the following equation:Annualized Frequency = Number of Recorded Events or Event-Days / Period of Record

“A consequence is defined in the National Risk Index as economic loss or bodily harm to individuals that is directly caused by a hazard occurrence” (FEMA, p. 67) in case of CRI, consequence to ecosystems is also relevant

“Riverine Flooding is when streams and rivers exceed the capacity of their natural or constructed channels to accommodate water flow and water overflows the banks, spilling into adjacent low-lying, dry land.” (FEMA, p. 255)

## Tag: Community resilence

“Community Resilience is defined by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the ability of a community to prepare for anticipated natural hazards, adapt to changing conditions, and withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions.5” (FEMA, p. 48) https://www.nist.gov/community-resilience

“In the National Risk Index, Community Resilience is the consequence reduction risk factor and represents the relative level of community resilience in comparison to all other communities at the same level.” (FEMA, p. 48) equivalent to adaptive capacity

## Tag: CRF

“By design, the CRF ensures that higher Social Vulnerability and lower Community Resilience, relative to all other communities at the same level (county or Census tract), result in higher Risk Index values for a given level of EAL” (FEMA, p. 49)

“Given that academic research on quantifying actual versus experienced impacts is still in its relative infancy, consensus knowledge regarding community risk indices and their relationship with experienced impacts from natural hazards is limited. For this reason, three point estimation was selected to provide a framework for potential CRF distributions.” (FEMA, p. 50) [[Three-point estimation]]

## Tag: SVI

“The Social Vulnerability and Community Resilience Working Group reviewed and evaluated existing efforts to measure community-specific risk factors to understand which components are most important and which indices should be used.” (FEMA, p. 37)

“Social Vulnerability is broadly defined as the susceptibility of social groups to the adverse impacts of natural hazards, including disproportionate death, injury, loss, or disruption of livelihood.” (FEMA, p. 46)

“SVI is a location-specific assessment of social vulnerability that utilizes 16 socioeconomic variables deemed to contribute to a community’s reduced ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from hazards” (FEMA, p. 47) https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/php/svi/index.html

“a Census tract will not receive an overall SVI value if one or more of the 16 factors used to calculate SVI are missing from the American Community Survey’s 5-year estimates for the year 2020” (FEMA, p. 47) 

Here is the numbered list of the 15 Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) indicators:

- **Below Poverty:** Percent of individuals below the poverty line.**Unemployed:** Percent of civilian unemployed (for population 16+).**Income:** Per capita income.
- **No High School Diploma:** Percent of persons aged 25 or older with no high school diploma.
- **Age 65 or Older:** Percent of the population that is 65 years of age or older.
- **Age 17 or Younger:** Percent of the population that is 17 years of age or younger.
- **Disability:** Percent of the civilian noninstitutionalized population with a disability.
- **Single-Parent Households:** Percent of households with a single parent.
- **Minority:** Percent of the population that is a racial or ethnic minority.
- **Speaks English "Less than Well":** Percent of persons aged 5 or older who speak English "less than well."
- **Multi-Unit Structures:** Percent of housing units in structures with 10 or more units.
- **Mobile Homes:** Percent of housing units that are mobile homes.
- **Crowding:** Percent of occupied housing units with more than one person per room.
- **No Vehicle:** Percent of households with no vehicle available
- **Group Quarters:** Percent of persons in institutionalized group quarters.  

## Tag: methodology

“The team identified important risk indicator categories and specific indicators during the review (see Table 1).” (FEMA, p. 36)

[image]  
(FEMA, p. 36)

“the National Risk Index would involve three components: natural hazard risk (likelihoods and consequences), Social vulnerability, and Community Resilience.” (FEMA, p. 36)

“The Social Vulnerability and Community Resilience Working Group reviewed and evaluated existing efforts to measure community-specific risk factors to understand which components are most important and which indices should be used.” (FEMA, p. 37)

“The Data Analytics Working Group oversaw the spatial processing, normalization, and aggregation of data to arrive at the National Risk Index Methodology and calculation procedure that integrated the datasets identified by the other two working groups.” (FEMA, p. 37)

“The working group involved nearly 100 subject matter experts to equip FEMA with the data and information necessary for FEMA to make the decision of using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC)/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry’s (ATSDR) Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) as the new basis for the Social Vulnerability component of the National Risk Index.” (FEMA, p. 37)

“the Methodology is unique and carefully constructed to meet the specific needs of natural hazard risk assessment at both small and large geographic scales.” (FEMA, p. 38)

[image]  
(FEMA, p. 39) The Social Vulnerability and Community Resilience components are combined into one Community Risk Factor (CRF) which is multiplied by the EAL component to calculate risk using Equation 2.

“The function, f(∙) is atransformation that maps the ratio between Social Vulnerabilty and Community Resilience to CRF values” (FEMA, p. 39)

“Scores represent the national percentile ranking of the community’s component value compared to all other communities at the same level (county or Census tract).” (FEMA, p. 40)

“In the risk equation, each component is represented by a score that represents a community’s national percentile ranking relative to all other communities at the same level” (FEMA, p. 40)

“All scores are constrained to a range of 0 (lowest possible value) to 100 (highest possible value). To achieve this range, scores for each component are determined by the given value’s percentile ranking in the natonal distribution” (FEMA, p. 40)

(FEMA, p. 43) score to rating mapping

“Nationwide datasets used as inputs are in many cases not as accurate as locally available data. Users with access to local data for each risk component should consider substituting those data to calculate a more accurate EAL value at the local level.” (FEMA, p. 45) so should  the platform allow for user input to recalculate NRI or community risk factor?

“an annualized frequency model to determine EAL” (FEMA, p. 45)

“Certain rare hazard types (such as Earthquake, Hurricane, Tsunami, and Volcanic Activity) benefit from using a probabilistic model that estimates the likelihood of a hazard occurrence over an extended period of time, which can then be annualized” (FEMA, p. 45)

“Because there are no nationally available, bottom-up community resilience indices available, the Social Vulnerability and Community Resilience Working Group chose to utilize a top-down approach” (FEMA, p. 48)

“Community Resilience scores were inferred from counties to Census tracts by assigning each Census tract the score of its parent county” (FEMA, p. 49)

“By design, the CRF ensures that higher Social Vulnerability and lower Community Resilience, relative to all other communities at the same level (county or Census tract), result in higher Risk Index values for a given level of EAL” (FEMA, p. 49)

“Given that academic research on quantifying actual versus experienced impacts is still in its relative infancy, consensus knowledge regarding community risk indices and their relationship with experienced impacts from natural hazards is limited. For this reason, three point estimation was selected to provide a framework for potential CRF distributions.” (FEMA, p. 50)

“Three-point estimation is a risk analysis technique that is used to model the distribution of a random variable when information is scarce. It involves the use of existing information to establish a range, shape and mode to generate an approximate distribution for the variable in question.” (FEMA, p. 50) [[Three-point estimation]]

“One of the National Risk Index’s strengths is that it determines the EAL for an area at the lowest geographical level deemed appropriate, predominantly the Census block level.” (FEMA, p. 55)

“Data are also aggregated at the state level. Exposure and EAL values of all Census blocks within each state are summed to give that state’s values for each hazard type by consequence types” (FEMA, p. 55)

“Not all hazard occurrences are considered relevant for the annualized frequency calculation. Subject matter experts established that some hazard occurrences meet certain criteria to be included as a hazard occurrence capable of causing damage (e.g., Hail size of diameter greater than 0.75 in)” (FEMA, p. 62)

“For hazard types that track actual hazard occurrences, the historical hazard occurrence count quantifies either the number of distinct hazard events that have occurred (e.g., Hurricanes to hit the area) or the count of days on which a hazard has occurred (e.g., on how many days a Heat Wave event was reported)” (FEMA, p. 62) based on subject matter expert review of the source data

[image]  
(FEMA, p. 63)

“given the Tornado event locations (specifically, their proximity to the neighboring tracts), these four events could easily have occurred within, say, “Census tract B.” Therefore, “Census tract B” should not be represented as having no (zero) risk, and, yet, it would be zero if the annualized frequency was deemed to be zero based on the fact that no Tornado has historically occurred in “Census tract B.” (FEMA, p. 64)

“Three main solutions were incorporated to spread the area of hazard influence” (FEMA, p. 64)

“Building exposure value is defined as the dollar value of the buildings determined to be exposed to a hazard” (FEMA, p. 68)

“Population exposure is defined as the estimated number of people determined to be exposed to a hazard” (FEMA, p. 68)

“Agriculture exposure value is defined as the estimated dollar value of the crops and livestock determined to be exposed to a hazard” (FEMA, p. 68)

“Some hazard type exposure areas are represented as polygons in the source data, while others are represented as points, lines, or raster cells” (FEMA, p. 68)

“The HLR is the representative percentage of a location’s hazard type exposure that experiences loss due to a hazard occurrence or the average rate of loss associated with the hazard occurrence.” (FEMA, p. 72) this is similar to Percentage of affected assets (PAA) of CLIMADA

“. To begin the determination of this value, a Loss Ratio per Basis (event or event-day) (LRB) is calculated for each historical loss-causing hazard occurrence as the value of the loss divided by the exposed value for each relevant consequence type.” (FEMA, p. 72)

“Bayesianadjusted HLR value—computed for each county-hazard type-consequence type combination—serves as a prediction of the ratio of loss to exposed consequence type value that is expected from a single hazard occurrence.” (FEMA, p. 72)

(FEMA, p. 77) Consequence types are defined in the same way as the exposure

(FEMA, p. 53) Analytical technique for calculating EAL

“To support the processing of the National Risk Index, dedicated SQL Server and PostgreSQL database environments were established” (FEMA, p. 53)

“The database allows for computational efficiencies when calculating the factors of the EAL for more than 8 million Census blocks in the U.S” (FEMA, p. 53)

“The processing database also makes quality control easier by allowing complex calculations to be processed in steps” (FEMA, p. 53)

“For example, a change in source data for a hazard type only requires the replacement of source data tables for that hazard type and for the reprocessing of a single hazard type. The processing database also supports version control and allows backups of each version to be stored securely.” (FEMA, p. 53)

“The National Risk Index logically differentiates areas where a given hazard type is unlikely or has never occurred from areas where that hazard type is not able to occur using a control table in the database that designates where each hazard type is able to occur. This designationis based on counties that intersect past hazard occurrence polygons generated through spatial processing, have some possibility of occurrence as identified by probabilistic or susceptibility source data, or have recorded loss due to hazard occurrence.” (FEMA, p. 55)

“For more refined estimations of hazard exposure and frequency at the Census block level, the spatial representations of most hazards were intersected with a dasymetric subset of the Census blocks.” (FEMA, p. 57) dasymetric mapping uses building footprint dataset

“For the 50 states and DC, three input datasets identifying buildings are pixelated and are each spatially intersected with the Census block polygons to establish a building-Census block relationship” (FEMA, p. 57)

“Determining areas of spatial intersection between hazard occurrences or hazard-susceptible zones and the various levels of reference layers is an essential function used in calculating EAL” (FEMA, p. 58)

“Annualized frequency computations typically involve counting the number of hazard occurrence polygons that intersect the Census block” (FEMA, p. 58)

[image]  
(FEMA, p. 59)

“1. Hazard Occurrence Counting Using a 49-by-49 km20 Fishnet Grid” (FEMA, p. 64) use a bigger grid cell resolution to capture hazard occurrences

“2. Minimum Annual Frequency” (FEMA, p. 65) use experts to judge what would be the best minimum annual frequency for each hazard type

“3. Hazard Occurrence Shape Buffering” (FEMA, p. 65) increase the change of a hazard occurrences intersecting with neighboring census blocks

(FEMA, p. 69) hazard and susceptible zone generalization approach

“, a number of zero-loss records are inserted into the set of LRBs to make up the difference between historic occurrences and loss-causing events from SHELDUS so that the counts for both metrics are equal.” (FEMA, p. 83)

“The output of the LRB calculation (see Equation 12) and all corrective record insertion is stored in the LRB table within the processing database, and are then used to compute Bayesian metrics and calculate the weighting factors that are applied to find the hazard type Bayesian-adjusted HLR for each consequence type for the county” (FEMA, p. 83)

“a vetted risk model or equation was leveraged throughout all methodological development and that certain factors were not being interpreted inconsistently across the 18 hazard types.” (FEMA, p. 33) how can our project ensure consistency of definitions throughout the development process?

“All calculations are performed separately at two levels—county and Census tract—so scores are relative only within their level.” (FEMA, p. 40)

“if a factor used to calculate the EAL of a Census tract or county for a hazard type has a null value, the community is rated as “Insufficient Data.”” (FEMA, p. 44)

“The National Risk Index dataset and application are meant for planning purposes only and are intended for use as a tool for broad, nationwide comparisons.” (FEMA, p. 45)

“Predictably, this statistic places more populated states with higher building values in the highest percentiles while small and sparsely populated states are in the lower percentiles.” (FEMA, p. 56) EAL at state level is a sum of all EALs of all hazards of all consequences

“However, for hazard types with few hazard occurrences historically recorded, due to urban bias and varying demographics across the U.S., this equation is not always accurate or representative” (FEMA, p. 64)

“Additionally, as geographic boundaries are partitioned into much smaller regions (counties, Census tracts, and Census blocks), further challenges are uncovered resulting from the fact that geographic areas that have not been historically impacted by a hazard type and/or recorded hazard occurrences are being calculated as having no risk from that hazard type.” (FEMA, p. 64)

“type of exposure method used for each of the 18 hazard types” (FEMA, p. 69)

“The HLR is an area-specific” (FEMA, p. 72)

“Computing loss ratio averages and variances without including the zero-loss records produces very different results than when they are included. For example, a county with 100 historical Lightning strikes may only have two loss-causing events, one causing $40,000 in damage to buildings and the other causing $60,000. If the building exposure value is $10M, the loss ratios for each loss-causing event would be 0.004 and 0.006, respectively. If only the LRBs for two loss-causing occurrences were considered, the average would be 0.005. Including the 98 Lightning strikes that did not result in loss lowers the average to 0.0001, a more accurate approximation of the average Lightning strike’s impact on the county as not every Lightning strike is a loss-causing occurrence” (FEMA, p. 83)

“For several hazard types, regional Bayesian HLR weighting supplies a more accurate estimation of HLR for areas that have not experienced losses due to hazard occurrences during the period of record” (FEMA, p. 87)

“Evaluating historic economic loss from SHELDUS over a relatively brief period of time and comparing it to a static HLR exposure value does not account for changes in development patterns over these years. For example, a hazard occurrence in 1995 may have a low HLR when its loss is compared to its 2010 Hazus-derived exposure value; however, because of increased development and population influx over the years, its HLR would be much higher if the same loss were compared to the actual 1995 exposure value. There is an inherent assumption in the methodology that all buildings, population, and agriculture exposed to the hazard are static in economic value and quantity over the data period.” (FEMA, p. 91) this is a frequent challenge in risk modeling where socioeconomic factors are frozen in time

## Tag: riverine

“Riverine Flooding is when streams and rivers exceed the capacity of their natural or constructed channels to accommodate water flow and water overflows the banks, spilling into adjacent low-lying, dry land.” (FEMA, p. 255)

“Susceptible Area Source: FEMA, National Flood Insurance Program, NFHL80” (FEMA, p. 255)

“Susceptible Area Source: CoreLogic SFHA Layer” (FEMA, p. 255)

“Historical Event Source: NCEI, Storm Events Database81” (FEMA, p. 256)

“riverine floodplain polygons were intersected with the Census block developed area polygons within the processing database” (FEMA, p. 256)

“To determine exposure value for buildings and population, the sum of the developed areas of the riverine floodplain polygons for each Census block is multiplied by the developed area building value density and the developed area population density of the Census block to model the conservativecase concentration of exposure within the Census block” (FEMA, p. 257)

“The historic occurrence count of Riverine Flooding, in event-days, is computed as the number of days in which Riverine Flooding events (defined as having an Event Type of Flash Flood, Flood, Hail Flooding, Lakeshore Flood, Thunderstorm Winds/Flood, or Thunderstorm Winds/Flash Flood) were recorded in the NCEI Storm Events Database within the county from January 1996 to December 2019.” (FEMA, p. 259)

“This count is only performed for counties that intersect the 1% annual chance riverine floodplain” (FEMA, p. 260)

“Annualized frequency calculations use the NCEI Storm Events Database Riverine Flooding events for the county (see Section 17.5 Historic Occurrence Count) and divide by the period of record as in Equation 97” (FEMA, p. 260)

“Loss data are provided by SHELDUS82 at the county level, so this is the lowest level at which HLR is calculated” (FEMA, p. 262)

[image]  
(FEMA, p. 265)

“Once exposure, annualized frequency, and HLR have been calculated, the EAL is computed at the Census block level as in Equation 100. Performing the base calculations once at the Census block level and aggregating up allows for the most detailed and accurate estimation of EAL at higher levels.” (FEMA, p. 267)
