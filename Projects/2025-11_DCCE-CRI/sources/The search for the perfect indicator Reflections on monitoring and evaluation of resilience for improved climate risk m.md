# The search for the perfect indicator: Reflections on monitoring and evaluation of resilience for improved climate risk management

## Tag: case study

([Hallegatte and Engle, 2019, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/8BWSYFR6)) The same indicator used to measure development toward resilience can result in completely opposite outcomes in different contexts  
Consider two communities in very different situations. Community A suffers from minor droughts because it has minimal water storage potential and is completely reliant on rainfall for farming. Farmers in this community cultivate crops that can survive drought, but have low productivity. As a result, poverty is widespread in community A. Community B is richer and uses irrigation massively, applying groundwater pumping to provide the water, which leads to rapid salinization of the water reserves and creates a threat to longer-term water supply for agriculture and human consumption. Here, the question is whether universal resilience indicators can capture the nuance that community A can become more resilient due to investments in irrigation and move toward more water-intensive crops, while community B can become more resilient due to dis-investment in irrigation and a move to less water-intensive agriculture. Similar issues will arise with adaptive social safety nets, which may either make a community sustainable and resilient by facilitating coping during a bad year, or in other situations may keep people in locations where they have no credible long-term prospects, pathways to prosperity, and decent living conditions

“we should not forget that indicators create incentives, and that bad indicators create bad incentives” ([Hallegatte and Engle, 2019, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/8BWSYFR6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CBQRAGI4?page=3&annotation=66X9RFFU))

“This effect has been referred to as the Campbell’s law, which states that “the more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor”” ([Hallegatte and Engle, 2019, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/8BWSYFR6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CBQRAGI4?page=3&annotation=PASY3RLL))

“Resilience indicators should incentivize projects that are “robust” (i.e., projects that deliver development benefits under a wide range of possible climate and socio-economic conditions” ([Hallegatte and Engle, 2019, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/8BWSYFR6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CBQRAGI4?page=5&annotation=7CBTGSUD))

## Tag: challenge

“resilience can be directly observed only when a shock occurs, and may depend on the type and magnitude of the shock. As a result, it is difficult to measure and monitor” ([Hallegatte and Engle, 2019, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/8BWSYFR6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CBQRAGI4?page=2&annotation=VL7HU5RS))

“resilience-related outcomes that have far longer time horizons than typical development institution project cycles” ([Hallegatte and Engle, 2019, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/8BWSYFR6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CBQRAGI4?page=2&annotation=5LTA3Q8C))

“any imperfect indicator – with its inability to measure exactly what we want – can easily lead to perverse incentives for practitioners, and favor outcomes that are very different from those intended.” ([Hallegatte and Engle, 2019, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/8BWSYFR6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CBQRAGI4?page=2&annotation=LV8FA44A))

“complementing intrinsic motivation (i.e., the willingness of individuals to do their job properly) with extrinsic motivation (e.g., a monetary reward based on performance) can counterintuitively reduce the intrinsic motivation, to the point where the overall motivation is reduced by the additional monetary incentive” ([Hallegatte and Engle, 2019, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/8BWSYFR6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CBQRAGI4?page=3&annotation=EX5ZRH32))

“Positive lists of adaptation action (e.g., all irrigation projects count as adaptation to climate change) will struggle to account for the context of the operation and may lead to favoring one-size-fits-all solutions, and in some cases, maladaptation” ([Hallegatte and Engle, 2019, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/8BWSYFR6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CBQRAGI4?page=4&annotation=T8DL7ERM))

“indicators for resilience based on “avoided losses” or monetary benefits anticipated by the project might favor 'the project taking place in a rich neighborhood'” ([Hallegatte and Engle, 2019, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/8BWSYFR6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CBQRAGI4?page=4&annotation=9DRK4MWY))

“Indicators that focus on the number of beneficiaries (e.g., number of people with increased resilience) could very well drive business toward projects with marginal impacts but many beneficiaries. As a result, it becomes less likely that these projects will be transformational and help people escape poverty for good” ([Hallegatte and Engle, 2019, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/8BWSYFR6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CBQRAGI4?page=4&annotation=UC659N54))

“In response, the team adds a stand-alone component to the project that finances dikes and other coastal protection infrastructure. Here, the danger is that adding a separate component may give the impression that the problem is solved and the climate risks will be effectively managed. And indeed, this “simple action bias” is a well-documented behavioral bias” ([Hallegatte and Engle, 2019, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/8BWSYFR6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CBQRAGI4?page=4&annotation=SCDQSDI9))

“Indicators that label a project as resilient that has been designed using climate model outputs, without careful consideration, may encourage teams to design their project using a preferred climate model that labels it “climate informed” at the lowest possible cost” ([Hallegatte and Engle, 2019, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/8BWSYFR6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CBQRAGI4?page=5&annotation=4457XKET))

“it is evident that aggregated quantitative resilience metrics will only take us so far. Resilience is as much about infrastructure and financial instruments as it is about governance, voice, and empowerment. But governance, voice, and empowerment are not easy to quantify and measure, and should not be ignored at the expense of the search for quantified metrics.” ([Hallegatte and Engle, 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/8BWSYFR6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CBQRAGI4?page=6&annotation=WWEBZVV9))

## Tag: recommendation

“Risks created by imperfect indicators can also be reduced by combining several indicators. If an indicator is based on aggregated benefits, and therefore risks favoring better-off beneficiaries over poorer ones as highlighted in the example above, then a complementary indicator could be the same measure of aggregated benefits, but only counting people that are in the bottom 20% in terms of income” ([Hallegatte and Engle, 2019, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/8BWSYFR6)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CBQRAGI4?page=5&annotation=FKQ6WXBF))

([Hallegatte and Engle, 2019, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/8BWSYFR6)) Even more appropriate would be to develop **process-based** metrics to measure the extent to which projects are:   
1) designed to **account for climate risks** and other uncertainties and are flexible enough in their implementation and monitoring and evaluation (M& E) system to be able to adjust as climate risks ensue  
2) support resilience building **outcomes** in a given community, ecosystem, or country.   
Both could require that a range of climate models are used to stress test the project and identify the most appropriate activity or investment – **based on strict procedural norms** regarding how these different climate model outputs are taken into account to reach a robust decision.
