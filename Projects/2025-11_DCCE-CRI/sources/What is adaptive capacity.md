# ==Henry Antoine Bartelet, “Microeconomic Adaptation in Social-Ecological Systems.”==
- Adaptive capacity as used in a climate change adaptation context was initially strongly focused on tangible factors such as economic resources, technology, information and skills, and infrastructure (Smit & Pilifosova, 2001; Yohe & Tol, 2002)
- Within social-ecological systems (SES) theory, adaptive capacity is defined more broadly and includes not just a system’s ability to adapt to change but also its **ability to reduce its exposure and sensitivity to perturbations**, increasing its resilience

> Adaptive capacity  = counteract exposure and sensitivity. It is a modifier term in this sense, not a stand-alone quality of an entity

# ==[[Operationalizing and measuring climate change adaptation success]]==
“academic literature, which describes success as adaptations that support reductions in risk and vulnerability without compromising sustainability.” (Bartelet et al., 2025, p. 1)
