# Assessment Process
## 1. Dissemination and Submission of Work (การประชาสัมพันธ์และเปิดรับผลงาน)

The first step involves creating an understanding of the criteria and indicators, as well as the procedure for preparing documents for submission.

- **Application:** Local Administrative Organizations (LAOs), specifically **Municipalities (เทศบาล)** and **Sub-district Administrative Organizations (อบต.)**, interested in participating must express their intention and submit an application through the Provincial Natural Resources and Environment Office.

## 2. Evaluation (การประเมิน)

The evaluation is divided into three sub-steps: Self-Assessment, Area-Level Evaluation, and National-Level Evaluation.

### 2.1 Self-Assessment using the Self Assessment Report (SAR) System

Municipalities and Sub-district Administrative Organizations (อบต.) that apply must enter their data into the SAR system.

- **Data Entry:** LAOs must input comprehensive data related to their organization and the baseline data concerning city development. They must also evaluate themselves and complete the data entry.
- **Immediate Results:** LAOs can immediately view their self-assessment results once the data is complete.
- **Passing Scores (Self-Assessment):** The minimum passing scores for the self-assessment differ by type of LAO:
    - **City Municipalities (เทศบาลนคร):** Not less than 70%.
    - **Town Municipalities (เทศบาลเมือง):** Not less than 70%.
    - **Sub-district Municipalities (เทศบาลตำบล):** Not less than 60%.
    - **Sub-district Administrative Organizations (องค์การบริหารส่วนตำบล):** Not less than 60%.

### 2.2 Area-Level Sustainable Environmental City Evaluation (การประเมินเมืองสิ่งแวดล้อมยั่งยืน ระดับพื้นที่)

This level of assessment is conducted by the Area-Level Sustainable Environmental City Sub-committee (covering regions such as North, Northeast, Central, East, and South).

- **Method:** The evaluation is carried out via **Video Conference**.
- **Assessment Components:** The sub-committee assesses based on:
    1. Reviewing the data and submitted documents attached via the SAR system.
    2. Listening to presentations on city development work and **empirical results (ผลงานเชิงประจักษ์)**, including real activity site visits conducted through Video Conference.
- **Scoring Focus:** Empirical results are scored based on the effort exerted in implementation, **innovations** in city development, the resulting benefits, and **sustainability**.
- **Outcome:** The results from the Area-Level Evaluation (categorized as **Good (ดี)**, **Very Good (ดีมาก)**, and **Excellent (ดีเยี่ยม)**) are then submitted to the Steering Committee for approval and certification of the evaluation level.

#### 2.3 National-Level Sustainable Environmental City Evaluation (การประเมินเมืองสิ่งแวดล้อมยั่งยืน ระดับประเทศ)

This evaluation is specifically for Municipalities that received the **"Excellent" (ดีเยี่ยม)** certification from the Area-Level Evaluation in the previous fiscal year.

- **Committee:** This assessment is conducted by the National-Level Sustainable Environmental City Sub-committee, categorized by municipality type (City, Town, and Sub-district Municipalities).
- **Initial Method (Remote):** The initial stage involves assessment via **Video Conference**, covering:
    1. Reviewing information and documents attached via the SAR system.
    2. Listening to presentations on city development work and empirical results.
- **Final Method (On-site):** Following the initial remote assessment, the committee will conduct **on-site visits** to inspect activities and empirical results.
- **Purpose:** The goal is to filter and identify model cities ("แบบอย่างที่ดี") in each size category to serve as templates for other municipalities and to rank the evaluation results.
- **Outcome:** The results are submitted to the Steering Committee for approval. Awards are given in two categories: Winner of the Sustainable Liveable Municipality Award and Winner of the Sustainable Environmental Municipality Award.

### 3. Decision and Award Announcement (การตัดสินและประกาศผลรางวัล)

The Steering Committee for the Sustainable Environmental City Evaluation reviews and certifies the results of the National-Level Evaluation. The Department of Environmental Quality Promotion (กรมส่งเสริมคุณภาพสิ่งแวดล้อม) then announces the results and organizes the award ceremony.

---

### Evaluation Scoring Overview

The evaluation of performance in each indicator is based on 30 total points.
For most indicators (Indicators 1-23 in Components 1-3, and Indicator 34 in Component 4), the score breakdown is:

- **Process (การ):** 10 points (Focuses on implementation activities).
- **Output (ผลผลิต):** 7 points (Focuses on clear results in quantity and quality).
- **Outcome (ผลลัพธ์):** 13 points (Focuses on the success, continuous results, or expansion of the operation, and the benefits/impact on stakeholders and the environment).

For specific administrative indicators (Indicators 24-33 in Component 4), scores are determined based on the results of the most recent Local Performance Assessment (LPA) conducted by the Department of Local Administration, Ministry of Interior.

## Data presentation

### City Index
The computation algorithm groups the inputted indicators and does simple weighted averaging  calculation based on pre-determined weights

![[city index - SAR.png]]

![[ecological industry.png]]

### City Profile

Just aggregates and populate the data to make a summary visual
![[city profile.png]]

- City officials can choose to see the result per thematic assessment area
- There is also city's GHG emissions data , including only the carbon sink from green area and GHG emission from solid waste. The carbon sink is calculated based on the green area database; it also requires municipality officials to input data.
