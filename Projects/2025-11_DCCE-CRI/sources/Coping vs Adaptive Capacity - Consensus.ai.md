## **Coping Capacity vs. Adaptive Capacity in DRR and Climate Resilience**

The literature clearly distinguishes **coping capacity** as short‑term, largely reactive absorption, and **adaptive capacity** as anticipatory, long‑term adjustment that reshapes risk drivers and systems (Turchi et al., 2023; Mochizuki et al., 2018; Graveline & Germain, 2022; Chapagain et al., 2025; Béné et al., 2018).

### Origin & Link to Preparedness/Readiness

IPCC and UNDRR define **coping capacity** as the ability of people, organizations, and systems to use **available skills and resources** to manage and overcome adverse conditions in the short to medium term, requiring ongoing awareness, resources, and good management in normal times and during disasters (Graveline & Germain, 2022). This anchors coping in the same conceptual family as **preparedness** and “readiness” in Sendai: both depend on pre‑existing plans, resources, and organization.

Operationally, coping capacity includes:

- Execution of **pre‑planned measures** (civil protection plans, early warning systems, emergency stocks, temporary shelter, medical care) as the “reactive side of resilience” (Turchi et al., 2023).
- Use of **available resources and opportunities** (selling assets, borrowing, drawing on social support) to smooth consumption and maintain basic functioning (Mochizuki et al., 2018; Graveline & Germain, 2022; Imani et al., 2021; Faiz et al., 2025).

However, empirical work shows coping is not limited to formal plans. Households “try on their own” without external support, improvising irrigation, altering farm plots, changing watering schedules, and selling land to survive prolonged drought (Faiz et al., 2025), or mobilizing informal social networks during and after floods (Babcicky & Seebauer, 2017; Imani et al., 2021). Coping mechanisms are defined as **“specific efforts…to control, tolerate, minimize, or limit stressful circumstances”** during and after climate shocks (Imani et al., 2021). This supports an interpretation of coping that clearly **includes improvisational survival** alongside execution of preparedness measures.

By contrast, **adaptive capacity** in the IPCC tradition evolved from early “coping capacity” language to denote the broader ability of systems, institutions, and actors to **adjust, learn, and innovate** to reduce climate risks over time (Graveline & Germain, 2022; Chapagain et al., 2025). It involves transforming resources into adaptation actions, supported by governance, technology, information, and institutional arrangements (Bhowmik et al., 2021; Carter et al., 2015; Chapagain et al., 2025).

### Roles in the DRM Cycle

Several frameworks explicitly place coping, adaptive, and transformative capacities along time horizons and DRM functions:

- **Coping capacity**:
    - Ex‑post, short‑term measures that allow people and systems to **absorb impacts and react immediately** to sudden adverse conditions, restoring current levels of well‑being (Turchi et al., 2023).
    - Non‑erosive coping is defined as responding to adverse shocks in ways that do not increase indirect, longer‑term damage (Mochizuki et al., 2018).
    - Empirically linked to actions during and just after events (e.g., household coping during droughts or floods; social capital mobilized for response and recovery) (Bhowmik et al., 2021; Babcicky & Seebauer, 2017; Imani et al., 2021; Faiz et al., 2025).
- **Adaptive capacity**:
    
    - Ex‑ante, longer‑term, anticipatory adjustments that address risk drivers and reduce direct and indirect risk via **incremental system change** (Turchi et al., 2023; Mochizuki et al., 2018).
    - Includes urban regeneration, ecosystem restoration plans, multi‑stakeholder agreements, risk awareness programs, and livelihood diversification (Turchi et al., 2023; Bhowmik et al., 2021; Carter et al., 2015; Chapagain et al., 2025).
    - Closely associated with the “adaptive cycle” of socio‑ecological systems—learning and reorganization after disturbance (Mochizuki et al., 2018; Graveline & Germain, 2022).

In DRM‑cycle terms, the literature strongly supports:

- **Coping capacity** as most operational in **Response** and **immediate/early Recovery**, particularly the **absorptive/“stability”** dimension of resilience (robustness, redundancy, rapidity) (Turchi et al., 2023; Mochizuki et al., 2018; Al-Humaiqani & Al‐Ghamdi, 2022; Graveline & Germain, 2022).
- **Adaptive capacity** as central to **Prevention/Mitigation**, **Preparedness** (in the sense of building forward‑looking systems and institutions), and the **“Build Back Better”** side of Recovery that alters exposure, sensitivity, and social structures (Turchi et al., 2023; Mochizuki et al., 2018; Carter et al., 2015; Graveline & Germain, 2022; Chapagain et al., 2025; Béné et al., 2018).

However, several authors warn against a strict partition. Coping responses can influence future adaptation (e.g., asset preservation vs. distress sales) and adaptation often leverages lessons from prior coping (Bhowmik et al., 2021; Mochizuki et al., 2018; Béné et al., 2018). Adaptive social protection, for instance, is explicitly designed to move from short‑term coping support to strengthening households’ adaptive capacity over time (Béné et al., 2018).

### Shocks vs. Stressors in an IPCC Lens

IPCC AR5/AR6 distinguish **coping capacity** from **adaptive capacity** within a broader risk framework:

- **Coping capacity (IPCC)**: use of available skills and resources to manage and overcome **adverse conditions** and maintain basic functioning in the **short to medium term** (Mochizuki et al., 2018; Graveline & Germain, 2022). In practice, this is usually discussed relative to **discrete extreme events** (floods, storms, heatwaves, drought episodes) – i.e., **shocks** (Bhowmik et al., 2021; Mochizuki et al., 2018; Graveline & Germain, 2022; Imani et al., 2021).
- **Adaptive capacity (IPCC)**: combination of strengths and resources that enable actors to **prepare for and undertake actions** to reduce adverse impacts, moderate harm, or seize opportunities over the **long term** (Mochizuki et al., 2018; Graveline & Germain, 2022; Chapagain et al., 2025; Serdeczny et al., 2024). This is tied to **chronic stressors and shifting climatic baselines** (rising temperatures, changing rainfall regimes, sea‑level rise, increasing event frequency) (Bhowmik et al., 2021; Graveline & Germain, 2022; Chapagain et al., 2025; Serdeczny et al., 2024).

Conceptual frameworks therefore tend to map:

- **Coping capacity** → mediates how direct short‑term climate shocks translate into indirect, longer‑term developmental losses; its failure leads to “second‑order” loss and damage (Bhowmik et al., 2021; Mochizuki et al., 2018).
- **Adaptive capacity** → conditions whether societies can **adjust to evolving stressors**, maintain or enhance function under new climate regimes, and avoid recurrent or escalating loss and damage (Bhowmik et al., 2021; Graveline & Germain, 2022; Chapagain et al., 2025; Serdeczny et al., 2024).

Authors caution, however, that the same practice can serve both roles depending on time‑scale and depth of change. For example, short‑term flood coping that preserves assets and institutions may be a precondition for building adaptive capacity, while repeated “negative” coping (distress sales, erosive debt) can undermine long‑term adaptation (Bhowmik et al., 2021; Mochizuki et al., 2018; Béné et al., 2018).

### Agency and the “Intrinsic” Nature of Capacity

The ontological status of “capacity” has shifted from a static stock to a more agency‑ and governance‑centred view, especially for adaptive capacity:

- **Coping capacity** is often treated as relatively **intrinsic**, reflecting existing stocks of resources (assets, skills, infrastructure, social networks) and the ability to mobilize them under stress (Mochizuki et al., 2018; Graveline & Germain, 2022; Babcicky & Seebauer, 2017; Imani et al., 2021; Faiz et al., 2025; Smits & Huisman, 2024). Indices such as the GDL Vulnerability Index operationalize coping capacity as a dimension derived from socioeconomic indicators alongside adaptive capacity and susceptibility (Smits & Huisman, 2024).
- At the same time, coping capacity is clearly **relational and processual**: it depends on household decision‑making, social capital, and institutional support. Social capital both enhances coping (mutual aid) and can lower risk perception and precautionary action, illustrating that capacity resides partly in **social relations and behaviour**, not just material stocks (Babcicky & Seebauer, 2017; Imani et al., 2021; Faiz et al., 2025).

For **adaptive capacity**, the literature is explicit that it is not merely a stock but fundamentally about **agency, governance, and the ability to convert resources into action**:

- Adaptive capacity “extends beyond the mere accumulation of resources to encompass the willingness and ability to transform available resources into adaptive actions” (Chapagain et al., 2025).
- It includes **agency to activate** socio‑economic and biophysical components during shocks, prevention, and post‑disaster management (Chapagain et al., 2025).
- Over time, research has moved from asset‑based views to emphasize **institutions, governance quality, knowledge, innovation, and decision‑making processes** as core determinants (Bhowmik et al., 2021; Carter et al., 2015; Chapagain et al., 2025; Serdeczny et al., 2024).

Regarding **who the agent is**, the literature describes capacity at multiple scales:

- **Individuals/households**: choices about crops, migration, livelihood diversification, and risk management shape both coping and adaptive capacities (Bhowmik et al., 2021; Imani et al., 2021; Faiz et al., 2025).
- **Communities**: collective organization, community capitals, and local institutions influence community‑level resilience and the balance between “bouncing back” vs. “bouncing forward” (Mochizuki et al., 2018; Graveline & Germain, 2022; Kais & Islam, 2016).
- **Governance structures**: national and urban planning systems, social protection regimes, and climate policies create enabling or constraining environments for adaptation, often seen as the **backbone of effective adaptive capacity** (Carter et al., 2015; Chapagain et al., 2025; Béné et al., 2018; Serdeczny et al., 2024).

Overall, coping capacity retains more of an **intrinsic/stock‑plus‑mobilization** character focused on immediate functioning, while adaptive capacity is framed as a **dynamic, multi‑scalar property of socio‑ecological systems**, inseparable from agency, governance, and iterative decision‑making (Mochizuki et al., 2018; Carter et al., 2015; Graveline & Germain, 2022; Chapagain et al., 2025; Béné et al., 2018; Serdeczny et al., 2024; Kais & Islam, 2016; Smits & Huisman, 2024).
