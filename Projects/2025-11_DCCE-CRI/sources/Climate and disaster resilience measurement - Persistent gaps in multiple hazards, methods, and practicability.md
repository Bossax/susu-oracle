# How does the source discuss approaches of resilience measurement?
The source, a critical review by Laurien et al. (2022), examines 17 distinct climate and disaster resilience measurement approaches to evaluate their methodological rigor and practical utility for decision-makers. From a public policy and social science perspective, the authors analyze these approaches through three primary lenses: the integration of multiple risk drivers, methodological and technical composition, and their capacity to support decision-making.

**Classification of Measurement Methodologies** The source categorizes resilience measurement approaches into four technical types: scorecards, indices, models, and toolkits (Asadzadeh et al., 2017; Cutter et al., 2016).

- **Indices** aggregate multi-dimensional indicators into weighted values to reduce complexity.
- **Scorecards** evaluate progress against established benchmarks.
- **Models** utilize deductive processes and hypothesis-based mechanisms to approximate real-world resilience.
- **Toolkits** offer broader processes that may combine the above methods to assess resilience.

Furthermore, the source notes that these approaches can be conceptually distinguished by whether they measure resilience as a system trait (characteristic), a process (actions and interventions), or an outcome (temporary state) (Moser et al., 2019).

**Operational Frameworks and the "Five Capitals"** A significant finding in the review is the pervasive influence of the "five capitals" framework (sustainable livelihoods framework) across the selected approaches (DfID, 1999). Most tools assess resilience through the lens of human, social, financial, physical, and natural capitals. However, the authors critique the current landscape for underrepresenting "natural capital." While some approaches peripherally include ecological factors, specific indicators for ecosystem services and biodiversity are largely absent, suggesting a gap in understanding how ecological systems underpin societal resilience. Additionally, existing frameworks tend to emphasize absorptive capacities (stability) over transformative capacities.

**Handling of Systemic Risks and Multiple Hazards** The source highlights a disconnect between risk assessment and resilience measurement. While some approaches, such as the _Disaster Resilience Scorecard for Cities_ (DRSC), integrate risk assessments to prioritize shocks, most tools assess risk and resilience separately. A critical gap identified is the lack of "multi-hazard" integration; none of the 17 reviewed approaches fully accounted for the compounding effects of multiple hazards or the interactions between physical events and social risk drivers in their indicator design. While socioeconomic drivers are considered, they are often treated as generic indicators rather than interconnected variables that shift based on the specific hazard context.

**Practicability and Decision Support** In terms of application, the source discusses the tension between standardization and customizability. Tools designed for urban planning, such as the _ICLEI-ACCCRN Process_, allow for context-specific indicators, which enhances local relevance but complicates the comparability of data across different regions. The authors also note a reliance on mixed methods—combining quantitative data with qualitative inputs like focus group discussions—to manage the complexity of resilience measurement (Campbell et al., 2019). Finally, the source emphasizes that measurement alone is insufficient for governance; effective approaches must extend into action planning, providing roadmaps for policy changes, institutional mechanisms, and funding strategies.

# what are the gaps between data offered by risk and resilience measurement and decision making?

From a public policy and social science perspective, the review by Laurien et al. (2022) identifies a significant "research-practice-policy gap". While there is a surge in data generation through resilience measurement tools, these approaches often fail to translate effectively into actionable governance strategies for local authorities.

The disconnect between measurement data and decision-making manifests in the following key areas:

**The "Action Planning" Gap** For a governor or mayor, the primary utility of data is to inform resource allocation and policy intervention. However, the source notes that measurement is often treated as an endpoint rather than a means to an end. While some tools, such as the _Resilience Insight Tool_ (RIT) or _ICLEI-ACCCRN_, provide detailed roadmaps for institutional mechanisms, policy changes, and fundraising, many others lack a post-measurement process (Laurien et al., 2022). Consequently, authorities may possess data identifying vulnerabilities but lack the "how-to" guidance regarding specific interventions, roles, and responsibilities required to address them (Laurien et al., 2022).

**Separation of Risk and Resilience** Effective disaster management requires understanding both the probability of harm (risk) and the capacity to withstand it (resilience). A major gap identified is that these two concepts are often measured separately or using disjointed methodologies (Laurien et al., 2022).

- **Operational disconnect:** Most tools do not integrate risk assessments—such as hazard exposure—at the beginning of the resilience measurement process. This makes it difficult for decision-makers to prioritize shocks or understand the specific "resilience to what?" question (Laurien et al., 2022),.
- **Systemic blindness:** Current data products rarely capture "systemic risks," specifically the interactions between physical hazards (e.g., floods) and social drivers (e.g., poverty, governance failures). Without this integration, policymakers are left with a fragmented view that obscures how social vulnerabilities might amplify physical disaster impacts (Laurien et al., 2022),.

**The Tension Between Context and Comparability** There is a methodological trade-off that complicates high-level decision-making. Tools that allow for high "customizability" (selecting specific indicators relevant to a local context) generate data that is highly relevant for local urban planning but difficult to compare across different regions or municipalities (Laurien et al., 2022). Conversely, standardized tools allow for benchmarking but may miss the nuances of local governance and social fabrics that are critical for municipal leaders (Laurien et al., 2022).

**Temporal Gaps in the Policy Cycle** From a policy standpoint, data is needed throughout the disaster cycle—prevention, response, and recovery. However, the review indicates that most measurement approaches are designed solely for _ex ante_ (pre-disaster) assessment (Laurien et al., 2022). There is a lack of tools capable of measuring resilience trajectories _during_ or _after_ a disaster (_ex post_). This deprives decision-makers of real-time data regarding the effectiveness of their response strategies and the immediate changing states of community resilience (Laurien et al., 2022),.

**Sectoral and Institutional Silos** Finally, the data often fails to reflect the full spectrum of societal stakeholders. The source highlights a lack of tools tailored to the private sector, creating a "sectoral silo" where business resilience is disconnected from public disaster risk management (Laurien et al., 2022). Furthermore, generalist tools often overlook the specific "governance" aspects—such as zoning, building codes, and urban development plans—that are the primary levers of control for city officials (Laurien et al., 2022).

# Does the source discuss further the three categories of the approaches based on what they measure?

Yes, the source elaborates on these three categories—system trait, process, and outcome—primarily to highlight the methodological diversity and the necessary evolution of resilience measurement. Drawing on a meta-analysis by Moser et al. (2019), the authors distinguish these approaches by their primary focus: _system traits_ identify specific characteristics of a system; _processes_ focus on actions and interventions; and _outcomes_ assess the temporary states of a system (Laurien et al., 2022).

**Integration for Holistic Measurement** A key finding of the review is that valid resilience measurement should not rely on a single category. The authors conclude that future frameworks must strive to combine both "process- and outcome-based methodological perspectives" to represent resilience in the most standardized and holistic manner possible (Laurien et al., 2022),. This combination is viewed as an "organizing concept" capable of capturing the complexity and uncertainty inherent in dynamic systems.

**Current Gaps and Challenges** The source notes that finding the right balance between these categories remains a significant challenge for practitioners.

- **Capacity vs. Transformation:** Most current approaches focus on measuring "capacities" (a variation of system traits) rooted in the five capitals framework. These tools frequently measure absorptive and adaptive capacities but often underrepresent transformative capacities (Laurien et al., 2022).
- **Simplicity vs. Depth:** The authors observe that "lighter" or more simplified approaches often fail to comprehensively address the trade-offs between measuring resilience as an outcome versus a process (Laurien et al., 2022).
- **Temporal Dynamics:** There is a specific need for "more rigorous process-based approaches" that can incorporate outputs directly into decision-making, particularly those that can track dynamics over time rather than just static traits (Laurien et al., 2022).
