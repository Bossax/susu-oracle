# 1. Current project health & priority

The project status is **Stable but Pivot-Critical**. We have two parallel priorities: **1) Methodological Diplomacy** (resolving Phase 1 data authority issues via "Constrained Redistribution") and **2) Resilience Profiling** (executing the Phase 2 shift to "Coping/Adaptive/Transformative" capacities). The immediate goal is to finalize the "Hybrid Data" methodology to secure line agency buy-in while simultaneously tagging the administrative data for the new index.

# 2. Near‑term focus (next 2–4 weeks)

1. **Methodology Note (WP2):** Draft the "Hybrid Data" defense strategy for the Inception Report (Satellites = Disaggregation, not Replacement).
    
2. **Gap Flagging (WP2):** Run the historical hazard cross-check to flag "Administrative Gaps" (Disaster Yes / Relief No) to prevent "False Zeros."
    
3. **Capacity Tagging (WP3):** Continue the systematic review of administrative datasets (LPA, Sustainable City), tagging indicators for the Resilience Index.
    
4. **Redistribution Setup (WP3):** Configure the dasymetric workflow using **WorldPop (100m)** for population and **Agri-Map + ESA WorldCover** for agriculture.
    
5. **Visualization Design:** Draft the "Capacity Radar Chart" mockups and the "District Hotspot Map" comparisons.
    

# 3. Key decisions & assumptions to remember

- **Strategy Pivot:** We are moving to a **"Capacity Profile"** approach (Coping/Adaptive/Transformative) using synthesized national data.
    
- **Constrained Redistribution:** All satellite-derived maps must sum **exactly** to DOPA official district counts to ensure political auditability.
    
- **Metric Definition:** The "Economic" data is **Government Relief** (Fiscal), not Total Physical Damage.
    
- **The "Latent" Compromise:** Excess population found by satellites will be separated into a "Latent Population" layer, preserving the validity of official DOPA numbers.
    
- **Data Assumption:** We assume binary administrative data (Yes/No) can be aggregated into meaningful "Structural Readiness" scores.
    

# 4. Imminent milestones & deadlines

- **Feb 15, 2026:** Final "Hybrid Data Methodology Note" (Internal Review) & Revised Impact Formula.
    
- **Feb 28, 2026:** Completion of Gap Analysis Report (WP2) with "Data Quality Flags."
    
- **March 2026:** First Consultation Workshop – Presentation of the "Capacity Profile" & "Constrained Map" concept.
    
- **April 2026:** Start of District-level Map Production.
    

# 5. Short‑term risks & watchpoints

- **The "Correction" Insult:** Presenting global data as "better" than DOPA risks rejection; we must frame it as a "Visualization Tool" for official stats.
    
- **Binary Data "Clumping":** Aggregating Yes/No administrative data may result in identical scores for many provinces; a weighting strategy is needed.
    
- **Zero-Data Distortion:** Dasymetric mapping of a "Zero Relief" province produces a high-resolution map of nothing; the "Gap Flag" protocol must be rigorous.
    

# 6. Next sponsor/steering message

- **Dual Progress:** We are advancing on two fronts: solving the Phase 1 "Data Conflict" and building the Phase 2 "Resilience Framework."
    
- **Risk Retired:** We have solved the data authority risk by using **"Constrained Redistribution"**—our high-resolution district maps will **match official Ministry totals exactly**.
    
- **Strategic Pivot:** We are ready to present the **"Capacity Profile"** (Radar Charts) and **"Fiscal Relief Index"** concepts.
    
- **Best of Both Worlds:** We combine the _Legal Authority_ of DOPA/Agri-Map with the _Spatial Precision_ of WorldPop/ESA Satellites.
    
- **Next Step:** We are drafting a "Methodology Note" to explain this safe, hybrid approach at the March workshop.
