# Definition
## Resilience definition
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its AR6 provides a foundational definition, stating that climate resilience is the "capacity of social, economic and ecosystems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation". #IPCC

## Readiness definition
While resilience describes the capacities needed to respond to climate impacts, readiness describes the underlying conditions that enable those capacities to be built and deployed effectively. A municipality can develop sophisticated resilience plans, but without the necessary readiness, these plans may never be implemented.

**According to ND-GAIN**
	Readiness measures a country's ability to leverage investments and convert them to adaptation actions. ND-GAIN measures overall readiness by considering three components: economic readiness, governance readiness and social readiness.

- **Absorptive/Coping Capacity:** This is the first line of defense. It is the ability of individuals, communities, organizations, and systems to absorb the impacts of shocks and stresses and cope with them using available skills and resources. Coping capacity involves immediate actions to manage adverse conditions, such as a household drawing on savings after a flood or a city activating its emergency operations center during a storm. It is about withstanding a known shock and maintaining stability.   
    
- **Adaptive Capacity:** When coping mechanisms are insufficient to manage changing conditions, adaptive capacity becomes crucial. This is the ability of a system to adjust its characteristics, behaviors, and processes to better manage existing climate variability and future climate change. Adaptive capacity involves incremental adjustments and learning, such as farmers switching to drought-resistant crops in response to changing rainfall patterns or a municipality updating its building codes to account for increased flood risk. It is the capacity to evolve and expand the system's coping range over the medium term.   
    
- **Transformative Capacity:** In situations where existing systems and ways of life are no longer viable due to the severity of climate impacts, transformative capacity is required. This is the ability to undertake fundamental, system-level changes that create a new, more resilient state. Transformation challenges the status quo and involves deep, structural shifts, such as relocating communities away from high-risk coastal areas (managed retreat) or fundamentally diversifying a local economy away from a climate-vulnerable industry. It is a proactive response to the reality that incremental adaptation may not be enough.

# Relationships among the concepts

The concepts of resilience and readiness can be mapped directly onto the IPCC risk framework, clarifying their function in risk reduction. The key linkage occurs within the **vulnerability** component. As established, vulnerability is a function of two key factors:

- **Sensitivity:** The degree to which a system or species is affected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate variability or change. For example, a local economy heavily dependent on snow-fed tourism is highly sensitive to rising winter temperatures. A population with a high percentage of elderly individuals is more sensitive to the health impacts of a heatwave.   
    
- **Adaptive and Coping Capacity:** These capacities, which form the core of resilience, directly counteract sensitivity. A system with high adaptive and coping capacity can have low vulnerability even if its sensitivity is high. The tourism-dependent community (high sensitivity) can lower its vulnerability by investing in year-round attractions and diversifying its economy (increasing adaptive capacity). The city with many elderly residents (high sensitivity) can lower its vulnerability by establishing a network of public cooling centers and a check-in system for vulnerable individuals during heatwaves (increasing coping capacity).   
    

Therefore, **resilience-building is fundamentally an exercise in vulnerability reduction**. Interventions that enhance absorptive, adaptive, and transformative capacities work to lower a community's overall vulnerability to climate hazards.


**Readiness** functions as a foundational meta-capacity. The economic, governance, and social readiness of a community determines its ability to successfully implement the policies and programs needed to build adaptive capacity in the first place. A community with low readiness will struggle to reduce its vulnerability, regardless of its intentions.

The following table deconstructs the IPCC risk framework and translates each component into practical terms for municipal planners, illustrating how these concepts connect directly to the tools of local governance.

## From Risk to Impact: Understanding Residual Risk

Even with the most comprehensive resilience strategies, it is impossible to eliminate all risk. **Residual risk** is the level of risk that remains after all feasible and cost-effective risk reduction measures have been implemented. This is the risk that a community knowingly or unknowingly accepts.   

The existence of residual risk is a critical concept for local officials. It reframes the goal of planning from the impossible ideal of "disaster prevention" to the pragmatic and ongoing process of "risk management." This framing helps manage public and political expectations, justifying continued investment in preparedness, emergency response, and recovery capabilities (i.e., coping capacity) even as the community invests heavily in long-term adaptation and mitigation. Managing residual risk involves strategies such as maintaining robust emergency services, establishing contingency funds, and promoting risk transfer mechanisms like insurance, all of which are essential components of a holistic resilience strategy.

# Measuring
##  The Rationale for Measurement: Why Quantify?
Measurement is not a purely academic exercise; it is a core function of effective governance and strategic planning. Quantifying resilience and readiness serves several critical purposes for local officials :   

1. **To Characterize and Model Resilience:** Measurement provides a structured snapshot of a community's current state, identifying key strengths and vulnerabilities that might otherwise remain hidden.
    
2. **To Raise Awareness and Communicate Risk:** A clear set of indicators can translate abstract threats into concrete, understandable metrics, facilitating communication with the public, elected officials, and other stakeholders.
    
3. **To Guide the Allocation of Scarce Resources:** With limited budgets, municipalities must make strategic choices. A quantitative assessment can help prioritize investments by highlighting the areas of greatest need or where interventions will have the most significant impact.
    
4. **To Build Resilience:** The process of measurement itself can build resilience by forcing a systematic evaluation of capacities and identifying specific areas for improvement.
    
5. **To Monitor and Evaluate Policy Performance:** Indicators allow a community to track progress over time, evaluating whether policies and investments are having their intended effect and enabling adaptive management of the resilience strategy.


## Integrating Measurement into the Theory of Change
For measurement to be truly effective, it cannot be an afterthought. The process of selecting indicators must be deeply integrated into a project's or a plan's **Theory of Change (TOC)** from the very beginning. A TOC is a description of how and why a desired change is expected to happen in a particular context.   

A useful framework for integrating resilience into a TOC is to ask three fundamental questions :   

- **Resilience OF what?** This defines the system of interest. Is the goal to build the resilience of a specific neighborhood, a critical infrastructure system (like the water supply), a particular economic sector (like local agriculture), or the community as a whole?
    
- **Resilience TO what?** This identifies the specific shocks and stresses the system faces. Is the primary concern acute shocks like floods and wildfires, or chronic stresses like drought, economic decline, and social inequity?
    
- **Resilience FOR what?** This specifies the desired outcome or objective. Is the goal to maintain essential services during a disaster, protect vulnerable populations, ensure long-term economic prosperity, or achieve a more equitable community?


## The issue of measurability
Resilience is highly dynamic and rather an emergent phenomenon that is difficult to fully captured. Vulnerable and non-resilient characteristics might emerge during disaster events due to the interactions among social, economic, and environmental factors. Thus, the design of resilience/vulnerability indices should embrace the uncertain nature of this quality. The focus should be how the indices can support decision at local level, not the methodological beauty. 


#  A Step-by-Step Approach to Local Index Development

This blueprint integrates best practices from established frameworks developed by organizations like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR).   

**Step 1: Form a Collaborative Planning Team** The foundation of the process is a diverse, cross-sectoral team. This should include representatives from key municipal departments (e.g., Planning, Public Works, Emergency Management, Public Health, Finance), elected officials, leaders from community-based organizations (especially those serving vulnerable populations), representatives from the local business community, and technical experts from local universities or consultancies. This team will guide the entire process.   

**Step 2: Understand the Situation and Local Context** Before indicators can be selected, the team must develop a shared understanding of the community's specific risk profile. This involves:

- **Identifying Hazards:** What are the most significant climate-related shocks (e.g., floods, heatwaves) and stresses (e.g., drought, sea-level rise) facing the community?    
    
- **Mapping Exposure:** What and who is in harm's way? This involves inventorying critical assets, infrastructure, and, most importantly, identifying the locations of socially vulnerable populations.   
    
- **Assessing Vulnerabilities:** What are the underlying conditions (social, economic, physical) that make certain people or systems more susceptible to harm?    
    

**Step 3: Co-Develop Goals and Indicators** This is the heart of the participatory process. Through a series of structured workshops, the planning team should:

- **Define Resilience Goals:** Based on the context assessment, what does a "resilient community" look like in this specific place? These goals should be clear and aspirational (e.g., "Ensure all residents have safe shelter during extreme weather events," "Maintain a diverse and stable local economy").
    
- **Brainstorm and Select Indicators:** For each goal, brainstorm potential indicators that can measure progress. This process should draw on both quantitative data (e.g., census data, infrastructure inventories) and local, qualitative knowledge (e.g., community members' perceptions of neighborhood safety and cohesion). The aim is to create a balanced dashboard of indicators across different domains (e.g., social, economic, infrastructural, environmental).   
    

**Step 4: Gather Data and Populate the Dashboard** With a list of desired indicators, the next step is to collect the necessary data. This involves:

- **Identifying Data Sources:** Tap into municipal records, state and federal databases, academic research, and community surveys.
    
- **Addressing Data Gaps:** Where quantitative data is unavailable, use qualitative assessments, expert elicitation, or proxy indicators. It is better to have an imperfect measure of an important concept than a perfect measure of an irrelevant one.
    
- **Establishing Baselines:** Collect current and, where possible, historical data for each indicator to establish a baseline against which future progress can be measured.   
    

**Step 5: Analyze and Communicate Results** The raw data must be translated into clear, compelling information for decision-makers and the public.

- **Visualize the Data:** Use maps, charts, and dashboards to present the findings. Tools like FEMA's Resilience Analysis and Planning Tool (RAPT) can help visualize data layers related to population, infrastructure, and hazards.   
    
- **Tell the Story:** Frame the results in a narrative that highlights key strengths, critical weaknesses, and priority areas for action. Avoid overly technical jargon.
    

**Step 6: Integrate into Planning and Take Action** The dashboard's value is realized only when it influences decisions. The findings should be used to:

- **Inform and Update Plans:** Integrate the resilience goals and indicators into core municipal documents like the Comprehensive Plan, Capital Improvement Plan, and Hazard Mitigation Plan.   
    
- **Prioritize Actions and Budgets:** Use the dashboard to identify the most pressing needs and allocate resources toward interventions that will have the greatest positive impact on the indicators.   
    
- **Assign Responsibility:** Clearly assign a lead department or agency responsible for monitoring each indicator and implementing related actions.   
    

**Step 7: Monitor, Evaluate, and Iterate** Resilience is not a static state; it is a continuous process. The dashboard is a living tool that requires ongoing attention.

- **Regularly Update Data:** Refresh the indicator data on a set schedule (e.g., annually) to track changes.
    
- **Monitor Progress:** Report regularly to leadership and the public on progress toward the resilience goals. Celebrate successes to build momentum.   
    
- **Periodically Review the Framework:** The community's priorities and the risks it faces will change over time. The planning team should reconvene periodically (e.g., every 3-5 years) to review and revise the goals and indicators themselves, ensuring the dashboard remains relevant and effective.
