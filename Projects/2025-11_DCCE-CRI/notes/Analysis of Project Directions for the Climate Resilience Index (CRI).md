## Introduction and client expectations

The Department of Climate Change and Environment (DCCE) plans to commission **Phase 2** of Thailand’s Climate Risk Index (CRI) study. The Terms of Reference (TOR) emphasise that the Phase 2 consultant should extend the methodology developed in Phase 1 and provide a tool that supports policy decisions. The objectives include (i) enhancing the CRI so that it can be used at provincial level to prioritise adaptation measures, (ii) serving as a decision‑support tool for central and provincial agencies, and (iii) building the capacity of regional and local agencies to provide data and understand the CRI. The TOR outlines detailed tasks: prepare a work plan, analyse the Phase 1 CRI and identify additional factors, examine data gaps and propose a data architecture, focus on vulnerable groups, revise the index and the assessment tool, conduct stakeholder consultations and workshops, field‑test the methodology in selected high‑risk areas, develop a data entry system that can be linked to DCCE’s data centre, and disseminate findings. The client’s initial TOR therefore expects an _updated climate risk index_ and an associated toolset for data collection and communication. However, through informal discussions the client has expressed uncertainty about the best direction for Phase 2, leaving room to adjust the TOR to make the outputs more actionable.

## Summary of potential project directions

### Track 1 – “Climate Risk Index” (ex‑post risk assessment)

This direction continues the approach used in Phase 1 and mirrors the **Global Climate Risk Index** methodology, focusing on **ex‑post impacts from extreme weather events**. It uses indicators aligned with the Sendai framework—number of deaths, number of affected people, and economic losses—which are compiled from national disaster statistics and aggregated at the provincial level. Weighting schemes are generally equal or follow the Germanwatch CRI model. The resulting index ranks provinces based on historical losses and relative impacts. The **DCCE spatial risk map**, which also works at provincial scale, provides a complementary spatial overlay but suffers from data granularity problems; it smooths out hot‑spots and can misrepresent intra‑provincial variability. The Phase 1 study acknowledged data gaps (e.g., incomplete economic damage estimates, absence of non‑agricultural sector losses) and recommended improving the disaster‑loss database and incorporating vulnerable groups.

### Track 2 – “Climate Resilience Index” (action‑oriented resilience assessment)

Rather than ranking provinces by past losses, this track focuses on **actionability and adaptive capacity**. The index would be co‑created with local administrations and draw on existing routine data collected through the Local Performance Assessment (LPA) and the Sustainable City Assessment. The LPA comprises a broad set of indicators on infrastructure, governance, service delivery, and planning; however, it is largely process‑ and output‑based and relies on self‑reporting, which can affect data quality. The Sustainable City programme evaluates municipalities on four themes—liveable city, happy people, sustainable environment and learning & good governance—and uses a combination of self‑assessment, regional evaluation and national recognition. Many of these indicators, such as wastewater management, disaster plans, green space or water management, are directly relevant to climate resilience. Track 2 would select or adapt these existing indicators, add a climate lens to definitions and scoring, and develop an index that can signal **capacity gaps and progress in adaptation**, rather than only past damage. The approach envisages linking the resilience index to action‑support tools, such as sectoral adaptation guidelines and adaptation finance instruments.

## Comparative analysis

### 1. Alignment with the client’s expectations

- **Track 1:** The TOR currently focuses on revising the CRI by analysing Phase 1 results, improving the data architecture and including vulnerable groups. Track 1 aligns closely with this expectation: it would refine the existing risk metrics, develop a data‑collection template and improve communication through updated risk maps and outreach events. Because it builds on the existing methodology, it can satisfy the client’s immediate need for a **provincial risk ranking** and a communication tool for central and provincial agencies. However, the TOR also mentions capacity building for local agencies; simply producing an ex‑post risk ranking may not address how local governments can reduce their risk.
    
- **Track 2:** This option expands the concept from risk to **resilience** and emphasises co‑creation. It would require adjusting the TOR to include the selection and adaptation of existing local indicators and active engagement with Local Administrative Organizations (LAOs) through workshops and pilots. Although more demanding, this responds to the objective of “building capacity and understanding among regional and local agencies” by embedding the index into existing assessment processes (LPA and Sustainable City). It would shift the output from a one‑off ranking to a **continuous improvement tool** integrated into local planning.
    

### 2. Synergy with the spatial risk map

- **Track 1:** The CRI and the spatial risk map are conceptually similar diagnostic tools. Both operate at the provincial level and rely on aggregated indicators. The spatial risk map has been criticised for **loss of granularity and masking intra‑provincial variability** and for limited decision‑making value. Developing another provincial‑scale index risks replicating these shortcomings unless the new CRI introduces higher‑resolution data or dasymetric techniques. Without methodological innovation, the synergy with the risk map may be limited to cross‑validation.
    
- **Track 2:** A resilience index grounded in local indicators would complement the spatial risk map. The map could continue to serve as a **diagnostic screening tool**, highlighting provinces requiring attention, while the resilience index provides detailed insight on **adaptive capacity and readiness** at municipal or sub‑district scale. By linking resilience scores to map‑identified risk areas, DCCE could prioritise interventions and monitor whether high‑risk provinces invest in critical resilience components (e.g., disaster plans, water‑management budgets, social protection).
    

### 3. Usefulness for local officials and plan adjustment

- **Track 1:** A risk ranking can raise awareness but offers limited actionable guidance. Provincial scores derived from disaster statistics do not tell local officials which sectors or communities to target, nor do they account for capacities that reduce risk. The spatial risk map already demonstrates that provincial aggregation obscures hotspots and policy levers. Local officials may perceive the CRI as a national reporting requirement rather than a planning tool.
    
- **Track 2:** By leveraging indicators that LAOs are already collecting (e.g., percentage of roads maintained, wastewater management, disaster plans, climate change management plans, green space), a resilience index could become part of routine performance management. The Sustainable City assessment allows LAOs to enter data into a self‑assessment system and immediately see results, while the LPA includes climate‑relevant planning indicators such as disaster prevention and mitigation plans, water management plans, climate change management plans, and risk management plans. Adapting these indicators with a climate lens would give local officials direct feedback on their preparedness and highlight specific gaps (e.g., absence of a risk management plan or poor water‑supply data). It could also link to existing sub‑national planning and budgeting cycles, consistent with the **One Plan** approach.
    

### 4. Project risks

**Data availability and quality:** Track 1 requires complete and reliable disaster loss data; Phase 1 noted difficulty in obtaining accurate economic damage figures, especially outside the agricultural sector and for provinces like Bangkok. While some improvements could be made, the project would still depend on central databases controlled by multiple agencies. Track 2 relies on self‑reported LPA and Sustainable City data; the LPA scoring is often prescriptive and check‑box‑oriented, raising concerns about data reliability. Moreover, some LAOs may not yet collect climate‑specific indicators or may lack capacity to adjust definitions.

**Stakeholder management:** Track 1 mainly involves national‑level consultations (100+ participants as per the TOR) and visits to a few pilot provinces. Track 2 would require deeper engagement with multiple LAOs, provincial committees and possibly other ministries to revise indicators and integrate the index into existing assessment platforms. This increases coordination complexity but could build stronger ownership.

**Timeline and delays:** A revised CRI under Track 1 could be delivered within the current TOR timeframe, assuming data can be obtained. Track 2 may need more time to design the index, pilot the methodology, adapt digital platforms (e.g., the SAR system) and train LAO staff. These activities could push the project beyond the original contract period unless phased carefully.

**Regulatory and procedural hurdles:** Changing indicator definitions or adjusting the scoring in national assessment schemes may require approval from the Ministry of Interior or other governing bodies. This red tape could delay the adoption of a resilience index. Conversely, the TOR’s dissemination component (publications, exhibitions, videos) suits Track 1; for Track 2, the outputs might need to emphasise guidance documents and training modules.

### 5. Contribution to the adaptation cycle

The adaptation cycle involves risk assessment, planning, implementation, monitoring and feedback.

- **Track 1:** Ex‑post risk assessment contributes to the _diagnosis_ stage. It can help identify provinces experiencing frequent or severe impacts and justify national investment, but it offers little guidance for planning or monitoring adaptation actions. Without linking the CRI to budgetary instruments or local plans, its influence on the cycle may remain limited.
    
- **Track 2:** A resilience index linked to existing planning instruments and budget processes could support several stages of the adaptation cycle. It can inform planning (by highlighting where capacities are weak), guide implementation (by aligning with specific local projects such as green space expansion or water management), and provide monitoring metrics for adaptive capacity. Integration within the **One Plan** system can create incentives to allocate resources based on resilience performance. However, this requires careful indicator design and capacity building to ensure that LAOs understand and use the index.
    

## Questions to clarify before selecting a strategy

1. **What is the priority outcome for DCCE?** Does the client primarily need an **updated risk ranking** for national reporting and communication, or is the goal to create a **capacity‑building tool** that local governments will adopt? Clear direction on desired outcomes will determine whether to continue with Track 1 or pivot to Track 2.
    
2. **Data readiness and accessibility:** Are comprehensive and reliable disaster loss datasets now available for all provinces, including non‑agricultural economic damage and vulnerable groups? Conversely, how complete and reliable are LPA and Sustainable City datasets for climate‑relevant indicators, and can they be modified?
    
3. **Institutional commitment to indicator change:** Will key ministries (Interior, Natural Resources & Environment, NESDC) support revising LPA and Sustainable City indicators to incorporate climate resilience? What processes and approvals are required to modify existing assessment frameworks?
    
4. **Capacity and resources for local engagement:** How many LAOs are willing and able to pilot a resilience index? Does the budget allow for comprehensive capacity building, platform modifications and follow‑up?
    
5. **Timeframe and scope flexibility:** Is the project timeline flexible enough to allow for iterative co‑creation, pilot testing and indicator refinement? If not, should the project adopt a phased approach (e.g., deliver an improved CRI first while preparing the groundwork for a resilience index)?
    
6. **Integration with budgeting incentives:** How can the index be linked to budget allocation or performance grants to motivate LAOs to improve their resilience scores? Are there existing mechanisms (e.g., provincial budget prioritization or performance‑based transfers) that can embed the index results?
    

## Conclusion

Both project directions offer value but serve different strategic purposes. **Track 1** is aligned with the current TOR and can deliver a refined provincial‑level risk index within a shorter timeframe; however, it risks repeating the limitations of the spatial risk map and provides limited guidance for local action. **Track 2** transforms the project into a **resilience capacity assessment**, requiring broader stakeholder engagement and potential adjustments to national assessment systems. While more complex and prone to delays, this track could produce a tool that integrates with existing planning and budgeting processes and supports multiple stages of the adaptation cycle. Clear decisions on client priorities, data availability, institutional support and resource allocation are necessary before finalizing the project strategy.
