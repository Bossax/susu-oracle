# DCCE Internal Focus Group Discussions
3 sessions designed to iterate the NCAIF design over the project period.
Based on your strategic pivot for FGD 1 (Exploratory/Ecosystem Mapping) and your new goals for the subsequent sessions, here is a refined strategy for **FGD 2** and **FGD 3**.

# Strategic Plan of the 3 Sessions

- **FGD 1 (Jan): The "Discovery"** – Mapping the ecosystem and constraints (as discussed).
- **FGD 2 (March): The "Prototype"** – Presenting the _Draft_ Solution (NCAIF) to get internal buy-in before going public.
    
- **Public Hearing (Apr):** Testing the concept with external stakeholders.
    
- **FGD 3 (May/Jun): The "Commitment"** – Processing public feedback and agreeing on the internal execution plan (Governance).
### FGD 1: The "Discovery" (Exploratory Ecosystem Mapping)

**Strategic Goal:** Map the technical landscape and constraints of parallel initiatives to position the NCAIF as the central "Integration Hub" rather than a competing system. This session focuses on understanding boundaries and dependencies.

**Timing:** Late January 2026.

**Key Stakeholders:**

- **Project Owners of Parallel Initiatives:** specifically those managing the **GHG Inventory**, **Adaptation M&E**, and **Climate Risk Index** projects.
    
- **Technical Leads:** Staff responsible for the data flows in these respective projects.
    

**Recommended Agenda:**

1. **"Ecosystem Mapping" (45 Mins):**
    
    - _Activity:_ whiteboard session to visually map where each project (GHG, M&E, Risk) sits in the DCCE data landscape.
        
    - _Key Question:_ "What data do you currently produce, and what data do you desperately need from others but can't get?"
        
2. **"Constraint Identification" (30 Mins):**
    
    - Discuss technical limitations of current systems (e.g., "The GHG system uses this specific coding standard," or "The M&E platform is strictly for reporting, not storage").
        
    - _Goal:_ Define the "Hard Constraints" the NCAIF must respect.
        
3. **"Positioning the Hub" (30 Mins):**
    
    - Introduce the NCAIF concept not as a new database, but as the "Translation Layer" or "Hub" that connects these silos.
        
    - _Outcome:_ Agreement on the high-level role of the NCAIF in the enterprise architecture.


### FGD 2: The "Preliminary Showcase" (Internal Stress Test)

**Strategic Goal:** "Bulletproof" the NCAIF before it faces external scrutiny at the Public Hearing. You want the DCCE internal teams to feel like _co-authors_ of the draft, so they defend it (rather than criticize it) during the public workshop.

**Timing:** Late February (Before the April Public Hearing).

**Key Stakeholders:**

- **Primary:** Adaptation Driving Group (Policy owners), Risk Assessment Group (Technical owners).
    
- **Secondary:** Representatives from the M&E and GHG groups (to confirm their feedback from FGD 1 was incorporated).
    

**Recommended Agenda:**

1. **"You Spoke, We Designed" (30 Mins):**
    
    - Directly link findings from FGD 1 to the current draft.
        
    - _Narrative:_ "In the last meeting, the M&E group mentioned 'unclear boundaries.' Here is how the NCAIF Taxonomy solves that using the 'Sectoral vs. Administrative' tags."
        
    - **Deliverable Presented:** The Draft NCAIF Business Artifact (Hierarchy/Taxonomy).
        
2. **The "Use Case" Walkthrough (45 Mins):**
    
    - Instead of showing a database schema, show a **Mockup Story**.
        
    - _Activity:_ Walk through a "Seed Use Case" (e.g., Flood Risk in Province X) prepared in Work Package 2.
        
    - _Prompt:_ "If we present this logic to the public/external agencies next month, will they understand it? Is this how you explain adaptation to the public?"
        
3. **The "Data Dictionary" Review (45 Mins):**
    
    - Deep dive into the **Logical Models** for "Essential Risk Assessment" areas.
        
    - _Goal:_ Confirm technical correctness. "Is 'Flood Depth' defined correctly here? Does this match the standard you expect?"
        

**Outcome:** A "Pre-approved" Draft NCAIF ready for the public hearing.

### FGD 3: The "Synthesis & Roadmap" (The Handover)

**Strategic Goal:** Translate the "Public Feedback" and the "NCAIF Design" into a concrete **Internal Action Plan**. This session shifts from _designing_ the system to _owning_ the system.

**Timing:** Mid-May (After the April Public Hearing & Prototype Demo).

**Key Stakeholders:**

- **Decision Makers:** Directors or Senior Officials (if possible).
    
- **Future Owners:** Digital Technology Group (System), Adaptation Division (Content).
    
- **Legal/Admin:** For the governance framework.
    

**Recommended Agenda:**

1. **Public Hearing "Reality Check" (30 Mins):**
    
    - Report back on what external stakeholders (ADPC, NGOs, other agencies) said.
        
    - _Focus:_ "They asked for X data. The NCAIF can handle X, but we (DCCE) currently don't collect it. This is our gap."
        
    - _Link:_ Use this to drive the **Gap Analysis** discussion.
        
2. **The "Integration Roadmap" Workshop (60 Mins):**
    
    - This answers your "Way Forward" requirement.
        
    - _Activity:_ **The "Next 12 Months" Timeline.**
        
        - **Phase 1 (Immediate):** Adopting the "Business Glossary" for reports.
            
        - **Phase 2 (Migration):** How to move the "Spreadsheet Catalog" into the future IT Infrastructure (Data Lakehouse).
            
        - **Phase 3 (Expansion):** Connecting the CU M&E E-form when it goes live.
            
3. **Governance "Signing Ceremony" (30 Mins):**
    
    - Finalize the **Data Governance Framework**.
        
    - _Key Decision:_ Confirm the **"Data Owner" vs. "Custodian"** roles.
        
    - _Question:_ "Who authorizes the upload of the 'Loss & Damage' dataset to the public portal?" (The answer must be a specific job title, not a generic 'team').
        

**Outcome:** A finalized **Implementation Roadmap** and **Governance Protocol** that DCCE can use to request budget for the full IT construction next year.
