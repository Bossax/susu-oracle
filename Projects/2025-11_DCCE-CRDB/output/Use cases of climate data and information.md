## Section 1: The Architecture of a National Adaptation Information Framework

A national adaptation information framework is the central nervous system for a country's response to climate change. It is not a static data repository but a dynamic system designed to produce and deliver "actionable climate information".1 The central thesis of this report is that the value of climate information is realized only when it is effectively integrated into decision-making processes across all levels of society. This requires a purpose-built architecture that moves beyond the mere provision of data to the delivery of tailored intelligence. The framework's architecture must be conceptualized as a complete "Climate Change Data Ecosystem" (CCDE), encompassing the full lifecycle of information from generation to application and learning.2

  

### 1.1 The Imperative for Actionable Intelligence

  Despite the growing availability of climate data, a persistent "usability gap" exists between the production of climate science and its application in real-world decision-making.3 The term "actionable climate information" is often used abstractly, yet what constitutes actionable intelligence varies significantly based on the specific actors, systems, and scales relevant to a given decision.1 Information that is useful for a national planner developing a 30-year infrastructure strategy is fundamentally different from what a farmer needs to decide on planting dates for the next season. The primary goal of this framework is to systematically bridge this gap.

This is achieved by transforming raw climate data into customized products and decision-oriented knowledge through a "value adding" process.3 This process involves more than providing access to data; it requires a deliberate effort to communicate knowledge with a particular goal and audience in mind, ensuring that information is delivered in a comprehensible and ready-to-use form.4 This approach aligns with international best practices, such as the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), which emphasizes the transformation of climate-related data into customized products that have clear societal and public use.5

  

### 1.2 Conceptualizing the Climate Change Data Ecosystem (CCDE)

  
To achieve this, the framework must be understood as a comprehensive Climate Change Data Ecosystem (CCDE). This concept, advanced by the PARIS21 consortium, defines the ecosystem as a community of interacting state and non-state data actors, the legal and policy environment in which they operate, and the technologies used to create, transform, and use climate change-related data and statistics.2 This model moves beyond a simple linear flow from producer to consumer, recognizing instead a complex, networked system.

The key actors in this ecosystem include traditional data producers like National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and meteorological agencies, alongside crucial users and co-producers in line ministries (e.g., Environment, Agriculture, Health), sub-national governments, research institutions, the private sector, and civil society organizations.2 The framework's success depends on fostering effective collaboration and coordination among these actors. This involves managing interdependencies and ensuring that information can flow seamlessly across organizational boundaries to meet user needs.3

The very process of designing and operationalizing such a framework serves as a powerful catalyst for institutional reform. It necessitates new forms of collaboration and formal data-sharing agreements, breaking down traditional silos between ministries (e.g., Environment, Finance, Planning, Agriculture) and between governmental and non-governmental entities. For instance, creating a single, integrated agricultural risk product requires combining meteorological projections with data on crop yields from the Ministry of Agriculture and water availability from the Ministry of Water Resources. This act of integration forces these entities to negotiate data standards, access rights, and shared responsibilities. The framework's governance structure, therefore, is not merely administrative; it is a driver of the integrated governance essential for a holistic national adaptation response.

  

### 1.3 The Four Pillars: Data Domains of the Adaptation Cycle

  

The framework is structured around four interconnected data domains that mirror the iterative adaptation process as recognized by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).6 This structure ensures comprehensive support for the entire policy lifecycle, from initial assessment to long-term learning and adjustment.

1. Weather and Climate Data: This is the physical science foundation, comprising historical meteorological observations and future climate projections for variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind.8 This domain provides the fundamental evidence of how the climate has changed and how it is expected to change in the future.
    
2. Climate Risk and Impact Data: This domain translates abstract climate hazards into tangible risks by analyzing them in the context of societal and environmental exposure and vulnerability.10 It combines climate data with information on population distribution, critical infrastructure, economic assets, and social vulnerability to answer the critical question for decision-makers: "So what?"
    
3. Adaptation Strategy and Measures Data: This domain encompasses the portfolio of potential responses to identified risks. It includes information on a wide range of adaptation options—from technological and engineering solutions to policy, institutional, and social measures—along with data on their feasibility, costs, benefits, and potential trade-offs.12 This domain helps answer the question: "What can we do about it?"
    
4. Adaptation Results Data: This domain focuses on Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (M&E) to assess the implementation progress and effectiveness of adaptation actions.14 It provides the data needed to track performance, ensure accountability, and generate lessons learned, answering the question: "Did our actions work?"
    

Crucially, these four domains do not represent a linear sequence but a continuous feedback loop. The adaptation cycle is fundamentally a learning cycle. Data on adaptation results (Pillar 4) is essential for recalibrating risk assessments (Pillar 2) and refining future strategies (Pillar 3). For example, M&E data showing the actual performance of new flood defenses during an extreme rainfall event provides invaluable information for updating flood risk models and informing future infrastructure investment decisions. An effective information framework must be designed to facilitate this feedback, transforming the national adaptation process from a series of static plans into an institutionalized system of adaptive management.15

  

## Section 2: A National Typology of Climate Information Users and Applications


A "one-size-fits-all" approach to disseminating climate information is destined to fail, as there is no single solution for adaptation.12 The effectiveness of the national framework depends on its ability to provide tailored, decision-relevant products. To achieve this, a systematic classification of both the

users of information and the uses to which it is put is essential. This section proposes a comprehensive, two-dimensional matrix that synthesizes various classification approaches found in the literature to create a typology tailored for a national government context.2 This matrix serves as the core organizing principle for the entire framework, ensuring that every data product developed has a clearly defined audience and purpose.

  

### 2.1 Dimension 1: A Typology of National User Groups


This typology moves beyond generic labels to create specific, institutionally-grounded user categories. It recognizes that different actors within the national CCDE possess distinct mandates, technical capacities, decision-making horizons, and information requirements.

- Category 1: National Strategic Planning & Coordination: This group comprises high-level government bodies responsible for setting overarching national policy and strategy.

- Examples: Office of the President/Prime Minister, Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Finance, National Climate Change Committee.
    
- Information Needs: They require highly aggregated, synthesized information, including national-level risk profiles, progress reports against NAP goals, data to support international reporting to the UNFCCC, and robust economic analyses of adaptation costs and benefits to justify national budget allocations.6
    

- Category 2: Sectoral Ministries & Agencies: These are the line ministries and specialized government agencies responsible for developing and implementing adaptation plans within their specific domains.
    
- Examples: Ministries of Agriculture, Water Resources, Public Health, Infrastructure and Transport, Energy.
    
- Information Needs: Their needs are highly sector-specific. This includes tailored climate projections (e.g., changes in growing degree days for agriculture, projections of peak river flows for water management), detailed sectoral vulnerability assessments, and technical guidance on relevant adaptation options.23
    

- Category 3: Sub-national & Local Government: This category includes the regional, municipal, and local authorities responsible for on-the-ground implementation, land-use planning, and direct engagement with communities.
    

- Examples: Provincial or State governments, Municipal and City planners, District-level administrators.
    
- Information Needs: They require high-spatial-resolution, localized climate data and risk information. Detailed vulnerability maps (e.g., urban flood risk zones, coastal inundation areas) and practical, actionable guidance on implementing measures like green infrastructure are critical.10
    

- Category 4: Private Sector & Finance: This group includes the full range of economic actors whose operations and investments are exposed to climate risks, and who are essential partners in financing and implementing adaptation solutions.

- Examples: Commercial and investment banks, insurance and reinsurance companies, critical infrastructure operators, large agricultural businesses, institutional investors.
    
- Information Needs: They require data that can be translated into financial terms. This includes asset-level physical and transition risk data to comply with emerging financial disclosure standards (e.g., TCFD, IFRS), information to inform supply chain management, and analysis of climate-resilient investment opportunities.29
    

- Category 5: Science, Research & Technical Intermediaries: This group consists of the knowledge producers and translators who form the technical backbone of the CCDE.
    

- Examples: National meteorological services, universities, public and private research institutes, technical consultancies.
    
- Information Needs: They require access to foundational data, including raw climate model outputs and observational datasets for research, model validation, and the development of value-added products. They also need platforms for collaboration and knowledge sharing.1 A critical subset of this group are the technical intermediaries—analysts within ministries, consultants, and NGO staff—who translate complex climate science into decision-relevant formats for end-users. Their unique needs include pre-processed but flexible datasets, analytical tools, and detailed methodological guidance.3
    

- Category 6: Civil Society, Communities & the Public: This broad category includes organizations representing vulnerable populations, community groups, and the general public, whose engagement is crucial for ensuring equitable and effective adaptation.
    

- Examples: Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations, Indigenous peoples' groups, journalists, and the general public.
    
- Information Needs: Their needs center on accessibility and relevance. This includes clear, understandable information on local risks, effective early warning systems, accessible information on government adaptation plans, and platforms that facilitate meaningful participation in decision-making processes.6
    

  

### 2.2 Dimension 2: A Typology of Information Applications

This typology categorizes the purpose for which information is used, mapping directly to the distinct stages of the policy and decision-making cycle.7 A nation's information needs are not static; they evolve as the country progresses through its adaptation journey. Early on, the emphasis is on scoping and assessment. As a NAP matures, the demand shifts towards operational decision-making, monitoring, and reporting. The framework must be an adaptive service, capable of supporting this evolution with an evolving suite of products.

- Use Type 1: Scoping & Awareness Raising: This involves initial engagement to establish the relevance of climate change and build momentum for action.
    
- Function: To inform, educate, and build political and public will.
    
- Activities: Public communication campaigns, high-level policy briefings, development of educational materials for schools and media.4
    

- Use Type 2: In-depth Risk & Vulnerability Assessment: This entails detailed technical analysis to understand the nature, extent, and distribution of climate risks.
    
- Function: To provide the core evidence base for subsequent planning.
    
- Activities: Mapping of hazards, exposure, and vulnerability; quantitative modeling of potential impacts; identification of at-risk populations, assets, and ecosystems.6
    

- Use Type 3: Strategic Planning & Option Appraisal: This stage focuses on the development, comparison, and prioritization of alternative adaptation responses.
- Function: To inform the formulation of national, sectoral, and sub-national adaptation plans.
- Activities: Identification of a portfolio of adaptation options, conducting cost-benefit analysis (CBA) or multi-criteria analysis (MCA) to evaluate them, and developing flexible adaptation pathways.13
    

- Use Type 4: Operational Decision-Making & Implementation: This involves the integration of climate information into routine, project-level, and emergency management decisions.
- Function: To guide the day-to-day execution of adaptation actions and climate-resilient practices.
- Activities: Designing climate-resilient infrastructure, adjusting agricultural planting schedules based on seasonal forecasts, issuing heatwave warnings for public health, managing water reservoir levels based on inflow predictions.23
    

- Use Type 5: Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning (MEL): This application focuses on tracking the implementation and effectiveness of adaptation actions to inform adaptive management.
- Function: To assess progress, ensure accountability, and generate lessons to improve future action.
- Activities: Tracking a defined set of adaptation indicators, conducting evaluations of project and policy outcomes, synthesizing and disseminating lessons learned.14
    

- Use Type 6: National & International Reporting: This involves fulfilling domestic and international reporting obligations on adaptation action and progress.
- Function: To demonstrate progress and maintain transparency for national stakeholders and international bodies.
- Activities: Compiling and synthesizing data for official submissions such as National Communications, Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs), and Adaptation Communications (AdComs) under the UNFCCC.12
    

The following table provides a systematic matrix for mapping these user groups against their primary information applications, creating a detailed blueprint of national adaptation information needs. This matrix serves as a powerful tool to guide the development of the data products detailed in Section 4, ensuring a direct line of sight from a specific user need to a tangible information product.

## Section 3: A Compendium of Data Use Cases Across the Adaptation Cycle

  

To ground the framework in practical reality, this section presents a comprehensive inventory of real-world data use cases. These examples, drawn from established practices and case studies, are structured according to the four foundational data domains. Each use case is linked to the user and application typologies from Section 2, demonstrating how different types of data are applied by specific actors to accomplish distinct tasks within the adaptation cycle.


### 3.1 Foundational Data: Use Cases for Weather and Climate Data

  

This domain covers the direct application of historical weather records and future climate projections (e.g., temperature, precipitation, wind speed, solar radiation). This information serves as the fundamental input for nearly all subsequent adaptation analysis and decision-making.

- Agriculture & Food Security: In one of the most weather-dependent sectors, historical and forecast data are critical for operational efficiency. Farmers and agricultural businesses use weather data to optimize planting and harvesting schedules, ensuring crops are sown after the last frost and harvested before damaging rains.23 Real-time and historical data on evapotranspiration and precipitation enable precision irrigation, conserving water and reducing costs.43 Furthermore, weather conditions like humidity and temperature are key drivers of pest and disease outbreaks; analyzing this data allows for proactive and targeted interventions rather than reactive, broad-scale pesticide application.45
- Users: Farmers, Agribusinesses, Ministry of Agriculture.
- Application: Operational Decision-Making.
    

- Water Resource Management: The management of water resources is fundamentally tied to weather and climate. Dams and reservoirs are operated based on inflows forecasted from predicted rainfall amounts, while irrigation systems are optimized using parameters like evaporation and soil moisture.24 For long-term planning, such as designing a new dam, hydrological models are calibrated using long time series of historical climate data to simulate streamflow and determine sustainable yields.24 In the short term, real-time data from weather satellites and radar is indispensable for flood forecasting, providing early warnings that allow for reservoir optimization and emergency response, with lead times of up to 72 hours.47
- Users: Water Authorities, Hydropower Operators, Ministry of Water Resources.
- Application: Operational Decision-Making, Strategic Planning.


- Infrastructure & Built Environment: Historically, infrastructure was designed using climate data from the mid-20th century. As extreme weather events become more frequent and intense, this approach is no longer adequate.49 Future climate projections are now being used to update building codes and engineering design standards to account for future climatic loads, such as higher wind speeds, greater snow loads, and more extreme heat stress.26 In the construction industry, daily and weekly weather forecasts are essential for project management, influencing decisions on resource allocation, workforce scheduling, and specific tasks like concrete pouring or roofing.
- Users: Engineers, Urban Planners, Construction Companies, Standards Bodies.
- Application: Strategic Planning, Operational Decision-Making.
    

- Energy Sector: The transition to renewable energy sources increases the energy sector's sensitivity to weather. Accurate weather pattern analysis and forecasts are used to optimize the production of wind, solar, and hydropower, and to manage grid stability.51 Temperature forecasts are also a primary input for predicting energy demand for heating and cooling, allowing utility companies to manage loads and ensure operational continuity.52
- Users: Utility Companies, Energy Grid Operators, Ministry of Energy.
- Application: Operational Decision-Making.
    

  

### 3.2 Consequential Data: Use Cases for Climate Risk and Impact Data

This domain focuses on use cases where foundational climate data is integrated with information on exposure (e.g., people, assets) and vulnerability (e.g., socio-economic conditions, adaptive capacity) to assess risk. This is where the potential consequences of climate change become tangible for decision-makers. The most powerful applications in this domain arise not from a single data type, but from the integration of data across domains and sectors. A public health assessment, for example, is most effective when it combines climate projections with epidemiological models and demographic vulnerability data.35 This integration transforms raw data into actionable risk intelligence.

- Public Health: Climate projections are used to assess future public health threats. By linking climate models with epidemiological data, health departments can project the future burden and changing geographic range of climate-sensitive diseases, such as vector-borne diseases (e.g., Lyme disease, West Nile virus) and water-related illnesses (e.g., cholera).25 This analysis informs long-term public health strategy. On an operational level, integrating real-time environmental data (e.g., temperature, air quality, satellite imagery of algal blooms) with health surveillance data enables the creation of climate-informed early warning systems, allowing for timely public health advisories and interventions during heatwaves or wildfire smoke events.53
- Users: Public Health Officials, Ministry of Health, Hospitals.
- Application: In-depth Risk Assessment, Operational Decision-Making.
    

- Critical Infrastructure Resilience: National security and economic stability depend on the resilience of critical infrastructure. Risk assessments in this area combine climate hazard data (e.g., future flood maps, sea-level rise projections) with detailed inventories of infrastructure assets (e.g., power plants, roads, water treatment facilities) to identify critical vulnerabilities.26 A crucial component of advanced risk assessment is the analysis of interdependencies and potential cascading failures. For example, an assessment might model how the flooding of an electrical substation (a direct impact) could lead to failures in water supply and telecommunications systems that depend on its power, magnifying the overall disruption.57
- Users: Infrastructure Operators, National Security Agencies, Ministries of Transport/Energy.
- Application: In-depth Risk Assessment, Strategic Planning.
    

- Financial Risk Management & Disclosure: The global financial system is increasingly recognizing climate change as a material financial risk. Corporations and financial institutions are using climate impact data to quantify their exposure in line with disclosure frameworks like the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).30 This involves using climate scenario analysis, often based on scenarios from the IPCC or the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), to stress-test investment portfolios and business strategies against different warming futures.31 This analysis helps attach a financial value to potential climate-related losses, informing risk management, capital allocation, and corporate strategy.32
- Users: Financial Institutions, Corporations, Central Banks, Investors.
- Application: In-depth Risk Assessment, National & International Reporting.
    

- Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) & Emergency Management: Emergency management agencies use integrated risk data to move from a reactive to a proactive posture. A core practice is the Hazard Vulnerability Analysis (HVA), a systematic process that identifies the hazards most likely to impact a community or facility and assesses its vulnerability to them.59 The outputs of these analyses, often visualized as risk and vulnerability maps like FEMA's National Risk Index, are used to prioritize preparedness efforts, inform mitigation investments (e.g., where to build flood defenses), and allocate emergency resources more effectively.62
- Users: Emergency Management Agencies, First Responders, Local Governments.
- Application: In-depth Risk Assessment, Strategic Planning.
    

  

### 3.3 Action-Oriented Data: Use Cases for Adaptation Strategy and Measures Data

This domain covers the use of information to identify, appraise, select, and design adaptation actions. It bridges the gap between understanding risk and taking action.

- Appraisal of Adaptation Options: When faced with complex choices, decision-makers need structured ways to think about their options. Frameworks like "Resist-Accept-Direct" (RAD) provide a conceptual guide for land managers to decide whether to try to maintain historical conditions (Resist), allow an ecosystem to change unguided (Accept), or actively steer it towards a new, more resilient state (Direct).64 To identify specific interventions, planners can consult curated catalogues of adaptation options, such as the EU's Climate-ADAPT platform, which categorizes measures by the climate impact they address and the sector they apply to.13
- Users: National and Sectoral Planners, Land Managers.
- Application: Strategic Planning & Option Appraisal.
    

- Economic Analysis of Adaptation: With limited public resources, demonstrating the economic rationale for adaptation is crucial. Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is a standard tool used to quantify and compare the costs of an adaptation project with its benefits (often measured as avoided damages) from the perspective of society as a whole.38 For example, a CBA could compare the net present value of investing in more efficient irrigation systems versus introducing new drought-resistant crop varieties for a farming community.38 A comprehensive CBA also accounts for ancillary benefits (or co-benefits), such as how restoring a wetland for flood control also improves biodiversity and water quality.66 Such analyses provide a strong business case for proactive investment in adaptation.68
- Users: Ministry of Finance, Planners, International Donors.
- Application: Strategic Planning & Option Appraisal.
    

- Feasibility and Policy Integration: The best option on paper may not be feasible in practice. Assessments of adaptation options, particularly in developing countries, must consider multidimensional feasibility, including technical, economic, institutional, social, and cultural constraints.69 For example, a new irrigation technology may be technically effective but fail if local institutions lack the capacity to maintain it or if it conflicts with existing water rights. Such assessments are critical for selecting and designing interventions that are contextually appropriate and have a higher likelihood of success.72
- Users: Policy Analysts, Development Partners, Project Implementers.
- Application: Strategic Planning & Option Appraisal.
    

- Developing Adaptive Pathways: Given deep uncertainty about the future, locking into a single, large-scale adaptation strategy can be risky. The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) approach offers an alternative. It involves developing a sequence of actions over time, starting with "no-regret" measures. The plan explicitly identifies "adaptation tipping points"—thresholds at which an existing strategy will no longer be effective (e.g., a seawall is no longer high enough for projected sea-level rise)—and pre-defines the next action to be triggered. This approach builds flexibility into long-term planning and avoids costly maladaptation.73
- Users: Long-range Planners (e.g., for coastal management, water resources).
- Application: Strategic Planning & Option Appraisal.
    

  

### 3.4 Performance Data: Use Cases for Adaptation Results Data

This final domain focuses on how data from monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is used to assess performance, facilitate learning, and ensure accountability. This is what closes the adaptation loop, enabling continuous improvement. A key challenge in this domain is navigating the tension between the data needed for deep, contextual learning and the data required for standardized, high-level reporting. A successful national framework must support both. It should enable the collection of rich, project-level qualitative and quantitative data for learning purposes, while also defining a clear methodology for how this information can be synthesized into a core set of national indicators for reporting.

- Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) Frameworks: To systematically assess effectiveness, adaptation projects and policies require robust M&E frameworks. These frameworks, often based on approaches like Results-Based Management and the Logical Framework Approach, define a clear theory of change and a set of metrics to track progress from inputs and activities to outputs, outcomes, and long-term impacts.14 Designing these frameworks is challenging due to long time horizons and shifting environmental baselines, but they are essential for understanding what is working and why.15
- Users: Project Managers, National Planners, Donor Agencies.
- Application: Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning.
    

- Tracking Adaptation Indicators: M&E frameworks are operationalized through a set of indicators. A balanced portfolio of indicators is needed to provide a comprehensive picture of progress. These can include: process indicators (e.g., "number of government staff trained on adaptation"), outcome indicators (e.g., "percentage of households with access to climate-resilient water sources"), and contextual indicators (e.g., climate hazard data used to interpret outcomes).80 The selection of indicators must be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) to be effective.83
- Users: M&E Specialists, National Planners.
- Application: Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning, National & International Reporting.
    

- Learning and Adaptive Policy-Making: M&E is not just for accountability; its primary purpose in adaptation should be to facilitate learning.16 The results and lessons generated from M&E are critical inputs for making evidence-based adjustments to ongoing projects and for informing the design of future policies.17 This aligns with principles of adaptive policy-making, which treat policies as "experiments" that should be subject to formal, regular review to test assumptions and trigger adjustments as new information becomes available and conditions change.85
- Users: Policymakers, Program Managers, Researchers.
- Application: Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning.
    

- International Reporting: Nations have commitments to report on their adaptation actions and progress under the UNFCCC. The Paris Agreement's Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) requires all parties to submit Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs) that include information on climate change impacts and adaptation.22 Data aggregated from national M&E systems provides the necessary evidence to populate these reports, as well as Adaptation Communications, demonstrating national efforts and contributing to the global stocktake of collective progress towards the Global Goal on Adaptation.86
- Users: National UNFCCC Focal Points, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
- Application: National & International Reporting.
    

  

## Section 4: A Catalogue of National Adaptation Data Products

The translation of diverse user needs into tangible, accessible, and usable information products is the ultimate purpose of the national adaptation information framework. This section moves from the abstract identification of needs to a concrete catalogue of proposed data products. These products are the primary interface between the framework and its users, and their design is critical to bridging the usability gap.

### 4.1 Principles of Product Design

  

The development of all data products should be guided by a set of core principles to ensure they are effective and provide maximum value to the national CCDE.

- User-Centric and Co-Designed: Products must be developed in close collaboration with their intended end-users. This process of co-design ensures that products are relevant, meet real-world decision needs, and are presented in formats that are intuitive to the user.1
    
- Clear Communication and Visualization: The way information is presented fundamentally determines its impact. Products must prioritize clear, compelling visualization and use language that is accessible to the target audience, avoiding overly technical jargon. This is especially true for products aimed at high-level policymakers and the public.4
    
- Adherence to FAIR Principles: To maximize their value and utility across the ecosystem, all foundational data should adhere to the FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. This involves using standardized metadata, open formats, and application programming interfaces (APIs) where appropriate.34
    
- Transparent Communication of Uncertainty: Climate projections are inherently uncertain. All products that use climate projections must communicate this uncertainty clearly and responsibly, providing information on the range of potential outcomes across different models and scenarios. This allows decision-makers to use the information to build robust strategies that perform well across a range of plausible futures.89
    

  

### 4.2 The Product Catalogue
The framework should deliver a tiered suite of products, catering to users with different levels of technical expertise and varying information needs. The following catalogue outlines key products, which are detailed further in Table 2.

- Tier 1: Foundational Data & Tools
- This tier is aimed at expert users, such as researchers and the technical intermediaries who conduct detailed analyses. It prioritizes providing comprehensive, flexible, and machine-readable data.
    
- Product 1: National Climate Projections Portal: A centralized, version-controlled repository of the best available downscaled climate model outputs (e.g., from CMIP6) for the country. This portal serves as the single source of truth for all official climate change analysis.27
    
- Product 2: Historical Climate & Hazard Database: A quality-controlled, easily queryable database of historical meteorological station data and records of past extreme weather and climate-related disaster events, drawing from national records and international databases.91
    

- Tier 2: Integrated Analytical Products
- This tier is designed for planners and analysts in sectoral ministries and sub-national governments. These products integrate foundational climate data with other datasets to provide direct insights into risk and vulnerability.
    
- Product 3: Interactive National Climate Risk Atlas: A web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) platform. This is a flagship product that allows users to visualize and overlay various data layers, such as future flood hazard maps, locations of critical infrastructure, and demographic vulnerability indicators. It empowers users to conduct their own place-based risk assessments.9
    
- Product 4: Sectoral Risk Dashboards: A series of web-based dashboards tailored to the specific needs of key economic sectors (e.g., Agriculture, Water, Health, Tourism). Each dashboard would present the most relevant climate risk indicators, projections, and potential impacts for that sector in an intuitive, graphical format.10
    

- Tier 3: Synthesized Information & Guidance
- This tier is targeted at high-level policymakers, the media, and the public. These products synthesize complex information into concise, accessible, and non-technical formats to support awareness, strategic decision-making, and accountability.
    
- Product 5: National Adaptation Progress Report: An annual or biennial flagship publication that summarizes national progress on adaptation. It would feature high-level indicators from the national M&E framework, highlight key achievements, discuss challenges, and feature case studies of successful adaptation in action.22
    
- Product 6: Climate Risk & Adaptation Policy Briefs: A recurring series of concise (2-4 page) briefs on specific, high-priority topics. Examples include "The Economic Case for Investing in Early Warning Systems" or "Climate Change Impacts on National Water Security." These are designed to quickly inform busy senior officials.88
    
- Product 7: Public Climate Information Portal: A public-facing website that serves as the main communication channel for the framework. It would feature accessible explanations of how climate change is affecting the country, provide information on government adaptation plans, and offer resources and guidance for citizens and communities.36
    

The following table provides a detailed specification for each proposed product, linking it directly to the user and application typologies and providing a preliminary technical outline.
