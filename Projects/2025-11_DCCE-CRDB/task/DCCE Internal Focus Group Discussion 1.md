# INTERNAL TEAM NOTE: DCCE Focus Group Discussion #1

Date: Thursday, January 22, 2026

Time: 09:30 – 12:00

Objective: Discovery & Trust Building 

## 1. General Tone & Mindset

- **The Vibe:** **Meeting with pioneer practitioners to learn about their lesson and potential clients who will consume our data products**
    
- **Key Message:** we are here to learn from your experience and seek for synergy with your plan. We also wants to help your teams achieve policy goals by actionable information services and data products

- **Do's:**
    - Validate their pain points ("That sounds frustrating, tell me more").
    - Praise existing systems 
    - Use "We" to mean the Project Team + Risk Assessment Subdivision
        
- **Don'ts:**
    - Don't use complex data engineering jargon (Data Lakehouse, Bronze/Silver/Gold) unless the IT group brings it up first.
    - Don't promise immediate software fixes (remind them we are designing the _Framework_ and _Governance_ first).

## 2. Session-by-Session Guide

### Session 1: Opening & Context (09:30 – 09:45)

- **Activity:** Presentation (Slide Deck).
    
- **Facilitation Goal:** Set the stage and lower defenses.
    
- **Presentation:**
    use a house analogy with components 
    1. 1st slide shows 3 visualizations
        1. what we have: components of the house like chair, desk, door, and some walls for room partition. These items are partially organized in right place.
        2. what we are doing: shows ongoing construction of house foundation and adding of home items
        3. what we miss: show house components that should be there to complement what is in there in the first 2 visualizations
    2. 2nd slide illustrate the concept of National Climate Adaptation Information Framework and Data governance
        1. the visualization consists of the first picture of scattering furniture items and signages positioned randomly and used in a non-intended ways. Then there is the NCAIF which is represented as a black box in the middle, to the left of the first picture . The right side of the black box is an organized house where things are in right place and rooms are partitioned correctly with clear signage 

- **Output:** Participants understand _why_ they were invited and that we aren't auditing them.

### Session 2: The Ecosystem Exchange (09:45 – 10:35)

- **Activity:** Roundtable / Show & Tell (10 mins per key group).
- **Objective**: understand what we have and what we are planning to do
- **Presentation**
	1. The slide show a 2x3 matrix
		1. rows = what we have and what we are planning to do 
		2. columns = what to talk about for each project
			1. objective: of doing the project
			2. product/output: what are the data products or outputs from that project
			3. target users: who are the users of the product

**Output:** A draft "As-Is Data Landscape Diagram" and a list of existing IT constraints.

### Session 3: Pain Points & Requirements (10:35 – 11:00)

- **Activity:** Semi-structured Discussion (Categorized by Theme).
    
- **Facilitation Process:**
    - Throw a "Problem Statement" on the screen and ask who relates to it.
    - _Moderator:_ "Who here has received a file they couldn't open or couldn't use? Why?"
        
- **Presentation**
	1. ปัญหาที่เกิดจากความไม่ชัดเจนของคำนิยามและกรอบทฤษฎี: need a visualization that displays miscommunication and confusion when data users are using DCCE data products (platforms, reports, etc)
	2. ปัญหาการเชื่อมโยงข้อมูลข้ามหน่วยงาน ทั้งภายในและภายนอกกรม ฯ: 2 pictures; one for within DCCE and the other for external organizations
		1. within DCCE : shows that now data is exchanged via different means such as API (best case),  internal documents. The flows of data is bilateral. No central hub for data discovery even within the department
		2. with external organizations: APIs in some cases, MOUs and official letters for project-based data collection, interviews are the major way for data discovery and really understanding the datasets.
	3. ปัญหาของการนำผลิตภัณฑ์ข้อมูลไปใช้โดยผู้มีส่วนเกี่ยวข้องภายนอกกลุ่ม: Various data products are hosted on a website. Search and discovery is still challenging . Shows different types of users with one very capable; can use data without asking questions; intermediate level users need some documents and guidance; beginner users require training.
	4. ปัญหาที่พบในการนำเสนอข้อมูลต่อผู้มีส่วนเกี่ยวข้องภายนอก: Depict confusion and communication when showing data to external stakeholders. Illustrate a gap between knowing the information and taking action of the stakeholders. 
	            
- **Output:** A prioritized list of "Pain Points" (Input side) and "User Needs" (Output side).

### Session 4: Use Case & The Future (11:10 – 11:40)

- **Activity:** Visioning / "Wishlist".
    
- **Facilitation Process:**

### **Session 5: Wrap-up (11:40 – 11:50)**

- **Activity:** Summary & Next Steps.
    
- **Facilitation:**
    
    - Summarize 3 key takeaways (1. Architecture, 2. Pain Points, 3. Use Case).
        
    - **Call to Action:** "We will digest this into a Draft Framework (NCAIF) and come back to show you the 'Prototype' in March."
        
- **Output:** Buy-in for FGD 2.

## **3. Roles & Logistics**

- **Lead Facilitator:** [Your Name/Senior Consultant] - Drives the conversation, manages time, keeps the tone "Humble Architect."
    
- **Technical Support:** [IT/Data Expert] - Steps in only for deep technical questions (API, Architecture) to show competence.
    
- **Note Taker 1 (Whiteboard/Visual):** Map the ecosystem flow _live_ on screen/board. This shows them we are listening.
    
- **Note Taker 2 (Detail):** Capture specific quotes (Pain points), names of software used, and contact persons for follow-up.
