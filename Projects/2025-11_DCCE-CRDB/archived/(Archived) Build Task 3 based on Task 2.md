Mapping the requirements reveals several key leverage points that create a powerful synergy between the two tasks.

---

### 1. Foundational Data and a Centralized Database

- **Task 3 Requirement**: To map existing M&E systems, identify spatial indicators, and assess their data sources. This involves a significant data discovery and curation effort.
    
- **Task 2 Leverage Point**: Task 2 is already mandated to do the heavy lifting of reviewing, collecting, cleaning, and standardizing national and international datasets on hazards, disaster impacts, and exposure into a **centralized SQL database** (specifically, a PostgreSQL + PostGIS database).
    

Instead of Task 3 starting a separate data search, its primary data source should be the validated, harmonized database built in Task 2. This eliminates redundant effort, prevents data silos, and ensures both risk assessment and M&E are based on the same authoritative information.

### 2. The Analytics Warehouse as the M&E Engine 

- **Task 3 Requirement**: To develop a "database," compute baseline values for indicators, and create a "prioritized set of indicators" .
    
- **Task 2 Leverage Point**: The data architecture in Task 2 explicitly includes an **Analytics Warehouse** (or a data mart). This component is purpose-built for the exact kind of work Task 3 needs to do: performing aggregations by district/subdistrict, calculating indicators, handling time-series data, and running complex queries ("heavy joins").
    

The "database" for Task 3 shouldn't be a separate physical system. It should be implemented as a logical schema _within_ Task 2's Analytics Warehouse. The scripts and queries to calculate the M&E indicator baselines can be run directly in this environment, leveraging its optimized structure for analytical performance.

However, since the work of Task 3  focuses on methodology and computation logic, we don't need to implement the analysis in a production based manner.

### 3. Automated Production of the Data Reference Sheet

- **Task 3 Requirement**: To produce a structured **Baseline Data Reference Sheet** containing the baseline values for each indicator, along with metadata.
    
- **Task 2 Leverage Point**: This reference sheet can be a direct, automated output from the **Analytics Warehouse**. Rather than a static Excel file that must be manually updated, it can be a materialized view in the database or a report generated by a script. The Application Layer's **API** from Task 2 could then expose an endpoint to allow users or other systems to download this sheet in various formats (CSV, JSON), ensuring the data is always current.
    

### 4. Integrated Spatial Visualization

- **Task 3 Requirement**: The M&E system is explicitly **spatial**, designed to understand differences in impact and vulnerability across areas, cities, and regions.
    
- **Task 2 Leverage Point**: Task 2 is building the entire visualization front end, including an **interactive map viewer** and a **GIS Server** (like GeoServer) to serve map data.
    
The spatial indicators and baselines calculated in Task 3 can be directly visualized on the risk mapping dashboard built in Task 2. This would allow users to not only see current climate risks but also track the progress and effectiveness of adaptation actions over time and across different geographic areas, all within a single, unified interface.


### How This Enhances Both Tasks

- **For Task 3**, this approach provides a massive head start. It gets a high-quality, validated data foundation and a powerful analytical and visualization platform without having to build them from scratch. This allows the team to focus on the core M&E methodology and indicator definitions.
    
- **For Task 2**, incorporating Task 3's requirements enriches the platform's value proposition. The system evolves from being a static risk assessment tool into a dynamic, full-lifecycle adaptation management platform that supports planning, monitoring, and reporting. This ensures the platform's long-term relevance and utility for Thai policymakers.


>[!important] Decision needed
>- [x] Decision: If we want to deploy Task 3 data products, Spatially explicit indicator catalog and  Spatial Baseline Data, with the Climate Risk Map Platform in Task 2? or we just stop at the methodology and computation logic, with recommendation to integrate the database in to the central data lake and simple visualization for demonstration.
>- [x] We could develop content and data products of task 3 in a separate environment. like fork the data environment of Task 2, simplify the format into excel sheet, and develop computation logic based on the static database.
