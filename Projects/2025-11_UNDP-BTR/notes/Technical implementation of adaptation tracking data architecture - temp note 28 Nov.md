# Approach
Update and correct approach
1. start from last year data. extract key projects and assign unique IDs
2. review line agency's annual reports. extract potential adaptation projects  assign unique IDs.
3.  design the input-output relationship: we need to think through what kind of report we want. What it talks about (themes, areas) and what entities of each area will be discussed. Then we can create a relationship diagram of inputs and outputs 
	1. what quantities need to be reported
	2. what qualities need to be represented
	3. what metrics, targets need to be represented
4.  design standard responses (or desired responses ) in place of *text* field. This will help us structure what are metrics, entities, aspects we want to capture
5. design the codebook database to organize these standardized metrics
6. design the rest of the databases around this groundwork
7. design excel database "master" file
8. design the data collection interface with rigorous data checking

# To decide
1. what kind of input-output relationship we want
2. what templates do we need
