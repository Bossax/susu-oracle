## Content

- **Observed climate trends and hazards**
	Key historical climate trends (temperature, rainfall, sea level, extremes), major hazard types (droughts, floods, heatwaves, storms, coastal inundation), recent notable events and slow‑onset processes, ideally linked to existing VA/NAP work.d

- **Current and projected impacts by sector and region**  
	Impacts on priority sectors (e.g. agriculture, water, coasts, health, ecosystems, infrastructure, urban systems) and on key regions or hotspots (e.g. deltas, mountain areas, informal settlements), distinguishing observed impacts from modelled or scenario‑based projections.
    
- **Risk profiles (hazard–exposure–vulnerability)**  
    Description of how hazards interact with exposure of people, assets and ecosystems, and with social, economic and ecological vulnerability; can include risk matrices or “high‑risk” systems (e.g. food security, critical infrastructure, key value chains).
    
- **Vulnerability assessment findings and drivers**  
    Main findings from national or sectoral vulnerability assessments; structural drivers such as poverty, inequality, governance gaps, ecosystem degradation, conflict or migration patterns, and how these differ across gender, age groups, Indigenous peoples and other vulnerable groups.
    
- **Distributional, equity and cross‑cutting dimensions**  
    Who is most affected and why (e.g. women, children, Indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, smallholders, fishers, urban poor), including intersectional aspects and the role of gender, social protection, health systems and cultural factors.
    
- **Data, methods and knowledge gaps**  
    Sources of information (observations, scenarios, models, local/Indigenous knowledge), methods used (e.g. qualitative, indicator‑based, probabilistic), limitations, and key data and capacity gaps that affect understanding of impacts, risks and vulnerabilities.
    

## Averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage

- **Overview of loss and damage context**  
    National understanding of loss and damage, including types of climate‑related events and slow‑onset processes that are already causing significant losses, and how this relates to existing adaptation and disaster risk management frameworks.
    
- **Evidence of economic and non‑economic losses**  
    Major recent loss and damage from extreme events (e.g. disaster loss statistics, economic damages to sectors, livelihoods, infrastructure) and from slow‑onset processes (e.g. salinization, glacier melt, sea‑level rise), plus non‑economic dimensions (health, culture, heritage, ecosystems, territory).
    
- **Measures to avert loss and damage (ex‑ante risk reduction)**  
    Policies and actions that reduce hazard, exposure or vulnerability before impacts occur, such as risk‑informed land‑use planning, ecosystem‑based approaches, resilient infrastructure standards, early warning systems, climate‑smart agriculture, and anticipatory actions.
    
- **Measures to minimize loss and damage (preparedness and response)**  
    Systems that limit impacts during and immediately after events, such as multi‑hazard early warning systems, evacuation planning, emergency preparedness, humanitarian response arrangements, contingency planning and climate‑responsive social protection.
    
- **Measures to address loss and damage (recovery, rehabilitation, compensation‑type measures)**  
    Post‑disaster and post‑impact measures like recovery and reconstruction policies, “build back better” programmes, relocation or planned retreat, livelihood diversification support, risk transfer and insurance schemes, shock‑responsive safety nets and other solidarity mechanisms.
    
- **Institutional arrangements and governance for loss and damage**  
    Roles of national and subnational institutions, coordination between disaster risk reduction, climate adaptation, social protection and finance ministries, as well as participation of local governments, communities and Indigenous peoples in relevant decision‑making.
    
- **Finance, technology and capacity for loss and damage**  
    Domestic resources, international support accessed or needed (e.g. funds, facilities, insurance pools), use of innovative finance (e.g. contingency funds, parametric insurance), and needs for technologies, data systems and human capacity to strengthen work on loss and damage.
    
- **Monitoring, learning and knowledge‑sharing**  
	How loss and damage is tracked (indicators, databases, assessments), how lessons from events are captured and used to inform adaptation and DRR, and how the country shares good practices and experiences internationally (e.g. under the Santiago Network or other platforms).

# Initial assessment 19 Dec 2025

Based on the detailed content of the **Adaptation Section of the Biennial Transparency Report (2024)** you provided, the report is **largely sufficient** to answer your questions. It offers comprehensive data on climate trends, sector-specific risks, and government strategies.

However, there are minor limitations regarding explicit **definitions** (which are often operational rather than academic) and specific **updates on external research** outside of government-cited studies.

Here is a breakdown of how the report addresses each of your questions:

### **1. Trends, Hazards, and Changes (Questions 1–3)**

- **Sufficiency:** **Yes, very high.**
- **Content Covered:**
    - **Trends (Q1):** Chapter 3.1 details historical trends (1951–2020) and future projections for temperature, precipitation, and sea-level rise1111.
    - **Intensity & Frequency (Q2):** The report explicitly notes significant variations, such as the oscillation between extreme drought (2019) and heavy rainfall (2017)2222. It highlights that while total annual rainfall may decrease, extreme daily rainfall (Rx1day) is projected to increase, leading to flash floods3.
    - **Understanding of Impact (Q3):** Section 3.2 provides an updated analysis using a "4x4 Risk Matrix" to map flood, drought, and windstorm risks across 2,000+ villages4.
        

### **2. Research and Updates (Question 4)**

- **Sufficiency:** **Partial.**
    
- **Content Covered:** The report cites recent sources from 2023 and 2024, such as the _UN World Population Prospects 2024_ and _Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation statistics (2024)_555.
- **Limitation:** It focuses on data used for national reporting rather than a broad literature review of all academic research published in the past year.
    

### **3. Drivers of Risk (Question 5)**

- **Sufficiency:** **Yes.**
    
- **Content Covered:**
    - **Hazards Intensity (Q5.1):** It explains the physical science basis (e.g., 1°C mean temp rise by 2030-2040) driving heat stress and storm surges6.
    - **Development Pathways (Q5.2):** Chapter 2 (National Circumstances) explicitly links risk to development factors like **urbanization** (Bangkok’s density increasing flood exposure) and an **aging society** (reducing adaptive capacity)7.
        

### **4. Vulnerable Groups and Systems (Question 6)**

- **Sufficiency:** **Yes.**
- **Content Covered:**
    - **Human Systems:** It highlights specific vulnerable groups such as **outdoor workers** (heat stress) and **farmers** (economic loss).
        
    - **Earth Systems:** It details risks to biodiversity, such as coral bleaching affecting tourism and species extinction due to shifting climate zones10.
        
    - **Spatial Vulnerability:** It provides specific lists of "High Risk" provinces for every sector (e.g., Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima are frequently cited).
        

### **5. Loss and Damage (Questions 7–9)**

- **Sufficiency:** **Yes.**
    
- **Content Covered:**
    - **Definitions (Q7):** While it may not offer a theoretical academic definition, Section 8 defines Loss and Damage operationally by categorizing it into **impacted provinces, fatalities, affected people, and economic damage value**12.
    - **Statistics (Q8):** Section 8.1.1 provides specific statistics on disasters from **2014–2023**.
    - **Projections (Q9):** Section 4.1 cites a UN ESCAP estimate of **USD 5 billion** in adaptation costs under RCP 8.514. [x]
### **6. Resilience and DRM (Questions 10–11)**

- **Sufficiency:** **High.**
- **Content Covered:**
    
    - **Definition of Resilience (Q10):** The report frames resilience through the concept of "Resilience by Smart DRM for 3s" (Risk Reduction, Management/Innovation, Integration). It details the components you asked for (preparedness, response, recovery) within its strategic pillars.
    - **DRM Practice (Q11):** Section 8.1.2 outlines the full DRM cycle, including early warning systems (e.g., Thai Disaster Alert, Cell Broadcast Service), emergency relief regulations, and post-disaster recovery assistance.
        

### **7. Strategies and Measures (Question 12)**

- **Sufficiency:** **Yes, very detailed.**
- **Content Covered:** Chapter 5 maps out strategies for all six key sectors (Water, Agriculture, Tourism, Health, Natural Resources, Human Settlements). It lists specific "Approaches" and "Guidelines" for each, such as shifting to man-made tourist attractions or promoting wet-and-dry rice farming.
    

### **Summary of Gaps**

- **Explicit Academic Definitions:** Questions asking for "definitions" (Q7, Q10) will be answered with _operational frameworks_ and _strategic pillars_ found in the text, rather than dictionary-style definitions.
    
- **Broader Research:** Q4 is limited to the citations used in the report (mostly government and UN agencies).
