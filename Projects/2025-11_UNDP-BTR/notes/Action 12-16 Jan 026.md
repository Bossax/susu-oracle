# Things to look out
~~1. e-form vs M&E manual = change analysis~~
2. indicator list overlap = check all the list of e-form against the prioritized list of indicators from our screening
3. BTR monitoring databases and indicators = check if e-from includes all aspects required by A-BTR 
4~~. Baseline framework shall be part of the 'evaluation' framework <!--todo: structure the baseline framework and draft guiding questions-->~~
~~4. The missing evaluation framework: DCCE might realize later in the project that a valid evaluation framework that aligns with Impact Evaluation concept is missing. How to mitigate the risk and mediate between parties?~~
~~5. clashes of definitions among CU researcher, TEI, and TDRI work~~
