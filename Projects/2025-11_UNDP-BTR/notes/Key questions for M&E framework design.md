When designing a Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) framework for climate change adaptation, it is essential to address several key questions across four fundamental groups: the context of policies and needs, the contents of the system, its implementation, and its products.

Here are the key questions to consider:

### 1. Questions related to the Context of Policies and Needs:

- [ ] **How does the M&E framework for Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) fit within the general policy landscape and other existing M&E frameworks?** This involves analyzing the legal foundation and policy context that necessitate the framework, ensuring it aligns with national and other relevant M&E activities.
- [ ] **What are the overarching goals and primary purposes of the M&E framework, and how are its results intended to be used?**. MEL systems aim to inform policies and practices by generating evidence and lessons, assessing whether adaptation actions are effective, how they work, and for whom, to support improved actions. Purposes can include tracking activities, assessing adaptation results, supporting accountability, and providing evidence for planning and decision-making.
- [ ] **What is the status of the MEL system's development and operationalization?** This includes assessing how far a country has progressed in establishing the system, whether it is reflected in policies, if operational frameworks and tools are in place, and if roles and responsibilities are clearly defined.
- [ ] **What are the key enabling factors necessary for the establishment and operationalization of the MEL system?** These include:
    - **Leadership and mandates**: Presence of relevant laws and policies that codify MEL roles and structures, and motivate stakeholder engagement.
    - **Institutional arrangements**: Identification of key state and non-state actors, their responsibilities, and mechanisms for vertical and horizontal coordination.
    - **Engagement**: Involvement of state and non-state actors in developing the MEL system and defining its objectives.
    - **Skills and capacities**: Availability of human resources and efforts to strengthen their ability to assess adaptation progress effectively.
    - **Finance**: Availability of financial resources needed to establish and operate the system.
    - **Data, knowledge, and communications**: Processes for generating and using information from the MEL system.
- [ ] **What is the defined scope of the M&E framework?** This determines the extent of monitoring and evaluation work, whether it applies nationwide, within specific industries or fields, at local (provincial/city) levels, or for particular programs/projects. A national-level framework, for example, covers CCA activities across all sectors, fields, and provinces, reflecting both implementation and effectiveness.
- [ ] **Who are the key subjects that the M&E framework will monitor and evaluate?** This includes all parties responsible for planning, formulating, and implementing CCA activities, such as ministries, agencies, and provincial-level People's Committees.

### 2. Questions related to the Contents of the M&E Framework:

- [ ] **What specific aspects should the monitoring content consider?** This involves deciding whether to focus on the process of activity implementation, adaptive solutions, the results of actions and solutions, or a combination thereof. To achieve comprehensive objectives, the framework should ideally monitor and evaluate both the process and the results of adaptation activities simultaneously.
    - **Process focus**: Tracks progress and level of implementation of adaptation policies, plans, and investments, as well as institutional capacity.
    - **Results focus**: Shows changes in reduced vulnerability, enhanced adaptation capacity, climate-related risk reduction, and effectiveness of actions.
- [ ] **What kind of information and data needs to be collected to achieve the goals of the M&E framework for CCA?**. This includes defining linkages with adaptation plans and Impact, Vulnerability, and Risk Assessments (IVRAs), targets, indicators, and the practical methods and tools for data collection, collation, and analysis.
- [ ] **Have indicators been developed to measure progress towards the objectives, and what criteria drive their selection?** Indicators should be **SMART**: Specific, Measurable, Agreed, Relevant, and Time-bound. Selection criteria also include data availability and quality, usefulness and policy relevance, and links with other topics/sectors.
- [ ] **How are Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) considerations incorporated into the approaches, methods, and tools of the MEL system?** This includes mentioning GESI in the approach, using specific GESI sampling, indicators, and methodologies, and providing evidence of GESI implementation in monitoring, reporting, and evaluation exercises.

### 3. Questions related to the Implementation of the M&E Framework:




### 4. Questions related to the Products of the M&E Framework:

- [ ] **What is the final product of the M&E Framework?**. This typically involves annual or periodic overall M&E reports on CCA activities from various levels and sectors, which are then summarized at the national level for government review and international reporting requirements.

- By addressing these questions, countries can develop a comprehensive and tailored MEL system that effectively tracks, assesses, and promotes learning for climate change adaptation.

**Analogy:** Designing an adaptation M&E framework is like setting up a sophisticated dashboard for a ship sailing through unpredictable waters. You need to ask:

- [ ] **What's our mission?** (Goals/Purpose) Are we just tracking speed, or also charting course corrections and the well-being of the crew and cargo?
- [ ] **What instruments do we need?** (Indicators & Data) Do we need a compass, radar, depth sounder, or a thermometer for the cargo hold? And how do we get reliable readings from them?
- [ ] **Who is responsible for what?** (Institutional Arrangements) Is the captain solely responsible, or do the navigator, engineer, and deckhands all contribute specific readings and insights?
- [ ] **How do we use this information?** (Learning & Products) Do we just log the data, or do we analyze it to adjust our sails, change course, or improve the ship's design for the next voyage?

Just as a ship's crew needs to constantly monitor conditions and adapt, countries need robust M&E systems to navigate the complexities of climate change and ensure their adaptation efforts are on course.
