## Executive Summary

The transition from the established Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system to the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) under the Paris Agreement represents a seminal moment in international climate governance. For developing nations, the Biennial Transparency Report (BTR) is the operational vehicle of this transition, replacing the previous cadence of National Communications and Biennial Update Reports with a more rigorous, frequent, and structured reporting regime. While the mitigation and inventory components of the BTR are mandatory, the Adaptation Chapter (A-BTR) remains a voluntary yet critical instrument for nations to demonstrate resilience, articulate financial needs, and influence the Global Stocktake.

This report offers an exhaustive analysis of the adaptation reporting landscape as of late 2025, specifically tailored for a "beginner" country such as Thailand—a nation characterized by high climate vulnerability, a maturing domestic policy architecture, and specific institutional coordination challenges. Drawing upon the Modalities, Procedures, and Guidelines (MPGs) of Decision 18/CMA.1, and synthesizing lessons from the first wave of BTR submissions by pathfinder nations like Panama, Guyana, and Iraq, this analysis constructs a strategic roadmap for Thailand.

The central thesis of this report is that Thailand must view the A-BTR not as a compliance burden but as a strategic asset for climate diplomacy and domestic integration. The analysis identifies that while Thailand possesses robust sectoral plans—such as the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) finalized in 2024 and the Climate Change Action Plan for Agriculture—the translation of these disparate policy documents into a cohesive transparency narrative requires a paradigm shift from "reporting on plans" to "reporting on progress." Common pitfalls identified include the "paper plan syndrome," where legal frameworks are reported in lieu of implementation evidence, and the failure to establish a causal link between adaptation actions and specific climate hazards.

To navigate these challenges, this report proposes a "Ladder of Reliability" developmental model. This three-phased approach guides Thailand from a qualitative, narrative-based baseline in the 2024/2025 cycle toward a quantitative, impact-oriented reporting system by 2030. By leveraging the flexibility provisions of the ETF and adopting best practices such as case-study deep dives and integrated Loss and Damage reporting, Thailand can establish itself as a regional leader in transparency while unlocking critical avenues for international climate finance.

## Section 1: The Strategic Evolution of Adaptation Transparency

### 1.1 From National Communications to the Enhanced Transparency Framework

The architecture of global climate reporting has undergone a fundamental transformation. For decades, the National Communication (NC) served as the primary repository for adaptation information, submitted on a quadrennial cycle that often allowed for data obsolescence and lacked structural uniformity. The Paris Agreement, through Article 13, introduced the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) to build mutual trust and confidence among Parties.1 The BTR, mandated for submission every two years starting December 31, 2024, acts as the operational heartbeat of the ETF.

For developing countries, this shift is profound. The BTR demands a synchronization of data streams that were previously siloed. Unlike the NC, which often functioned as a broad descriptive encyclopedia of national circumstances, the BTR is designed to be a tracking instrument.3 It requires Parties to answer not just "what are we planning?" but "how have we progressed?" This distinction is critical for adaptation, which has historically suffered from vague qualitative descriptors compared to the precise metrics of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation.

While the "shall" provisions of the BTR mandates apply strictly to national GHG inventories and tracking progress toward Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the adaptation section falls under a "should" provision (Article 13.8). This voluntary nature has created a divergence in global approaches.1 However, recent synthesis reports from the UNFCCC in 2025 indicate that the vast majority of developing countries are choosing to include the adaptation chapter.6 The rationale is strategic: an empty adaptation chapter implies a lack of vulnerability or a lack of action, neither of which serves the interests of a climate-vulnerable nation seeking support from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) or the Loss and Damage Fund established at COP27.7

### 1.2 The Value Proposition for Thailand

Thailand stands at a precarious climatic intersection. As a nation with an extensive coastline, an agrarian-based economy involving millions of smallholder farmers, and a capital city prone to subsidence and sea-level rise, its vulnerability profile is acute.8 The BTR offers Thailand three distinct strategic advantages that extend beyond mere regulatory compliance.

First, the BTR serves as a mechanism to validate the National Adaptation Plan (NAP). Thailand’s NAP, formally launched in 2024, identifies six priority sectors: Water Management, Agriculture and Food Security, Tourism, Public Health, Natural Resources, and Human Settlements.7 The BTR provides the international stage to demonstrate that this plan is being operationalized. By reporting on the implementation of the NAP, Thailand signals to the global community—and specifically to sovereign donors and multilateral development banks—that it has moved past the planning phase and is investment-ready.10

Second, the BTR acts as a forcing function for domestic institutional alignment. The process of compiling a BTR requires data integration across the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC), the Office of National Water Resources (ONWR), the Ministry of Public Health, and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, all coordinated by the Department of Climate Change and Environment (DCCE).12 This necessitates the breaking down of ministerial silos, forcing agencies to share data on "climate-tagged" budget expenditures and project outcomes in a way that domestic bureaucratic procedures rarely demand.

Third, the BTR is the primary vehicle for quantifying the "Adaptation Finance Gap." By juxtaposing the "Adaptation Needs" (Section D/E) against the "Support Received" (Section F), Thailand can provide an evidence-based calculation of the financial shortfall it faces.13 This moves the negotiation for climate finance from rhetorical appeals to forensic accounting, providing the Ministry of Finance with the data needed to advocate for greater international support or debt-for-climate swaps.

## Section 2: Regulatory Architecture and the Modalities, Procedures, and Guidelines (MPGs)

### 2.1 Deconstructing Decision 18/CMA.1

The operational rulebook for the BTR is contained in the Annex to Decision 18/CMA.1, known as the Modalities, Procedures, and Guidelines (MPGs). Understanding the nuances of these guidelines is essential for a beginner country to avoid over-compliance (wasting resources) or under-compliance (risking reputational damage).

Chapter IV of the MPGs outlines the reporting provisions for climate change impacts and adaptation. Unlike the GHG inventory, which is bound by the strict methodological tiers of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, the adaptation chapter is characterized by flexibility and narrative freedom.1 The MPGs categorize the reporting elements into eight broad thematic areas:

**Table 1: Analysis of BTR Adaptation Reporting Elements and Relevance to Thailand**

|**MPG Section**|**Content Requirement**|**Strategic Relevance for Thailand**|
|---|---|---|
|**A. National Circumstances**|Legal frameworks, institutional arrangements, and biogeographical context.|Opportunity to detail the _Climate Change Act_ and the _Climate Change Master Plan 2015–2050_, setting the legal baseline.12|
|**B. Impacts, Risks, & Vulnerabilities**|Current and projected climate trends and their socio-economic impacts.|Critical for referencing the 2011 floods and recent drought trends in the Isan region to justify priority sectors.7|
|**C. Adaptation Priorities**|Strategic barriers, challenges, and gaps hindering adaptation.|Space to articulate the "implementation gap"—why plans exist but resilience is not yet achieved (e.g., budget constraints, technical capacity).8|
|**D. Strategies & Policies**|Integration of adaptation into development planning (NAPs, sub-national plans).|mechanism to highlight the _13th National Economic and Social Development Plan_ and its alignment with climate goals.16|
|**E. Progress on Implementation**|Status of specific adaptation actions and measures.|The core "tracking" section. Must move beyond listing plans to evidencing active projects (e.g., SCALA project outcomes).17|
|**F. Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E)**|Systems used to track resilience and outcomes.|The most challenging section. Requires transparency about the nascent state of the DCCE’s M&E system.7|
|**G. Loss and Damage**|Information on averting, minimizing, and addressing loss and damage.|Vital for documenting economic losses from extreme weather, linking to the Warsaw International Mechanism.13|
|**H. Cooperation**|Sharing of good practices and international cooperation.|Highlighting ASEAN regional cooperation and South-South knowledge exchange (e.g., with Vietnam or Cambodia on rice resilience).13|

### 2.2 The Flexibility of "Should"

Developing countries must navigate the distinction between mandatory ("shall") and voluntary ("should") provisions. For the Adaptation Chapter, the "should" provision allows for significant latitude. Thailand is not required to report on every single element listed in the MPGs. It can choose to report on the areas where data is robust while omitting areas where data is scientifically uncertain, without facing a compliance issue.[^1]

Furthermore, the MPGs allow for cross-referencing. If Thailand submits an Adaptation Communication (AdCom) or a National Communication (NC) in the same year as the BTR (which is possible in 2026/2027), it can simply reference sections of those documents to avoid duplication.5 However, distinct guidance suggests that for the _first_ BTR, a self-contained summary is preferable to establish a clear baseline within the new ETF registry.2

## Section 3: Global Benchmarking: Lessons from Pathfinder Nations

Analyzing the first wave of BTR submissions from 2024 and early 2025 provides concrete examples of how diverse developing nations are navigating these requirements. A comparative analysis of Panama, Guyana, and Iraq reveals three distinct archetypes of reporting that Thailand can learn from.

### 3.1 Panama: The Integrated Vulnerability & Loss and Damage Model

Panama’s first BTR represents a high-ambition approach, particularly in its treatment of Loss and Damage (L&D). Rather than treating adaptation and L&D as separate silos, Panama’s report conceptually links them, acknowledging that adaptation limits exist and that residual risks manifest as quantifiable losses.15

The report is distinguished by its granular, sub-national focus. Instead of offering vague national generalizations, Panama provided climate risk indices for specific districts. This "case study" approach allowed them to present high-confidence data for specific regions while acknowledging that national-level data might be less precise. For Thailand, this is a replicable model. Thailand could focus its BTR reporting on the Chao Phraya River Basin or the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), providing deep, verifiable data for these high-priority zones, rather than attempting to aggregate data for all 77 provinces which might dilute the quality of the report.15

### 3.2 Guyana: The Narrative of National Circumstances

Guyana’s approach in its first BTR (submitted 2024) illustrates how a country can leverage the "National Circumstances" section to frame its adaptation narrative. Guyana utilized Chapter 1 to provide a comprehensive overview of its geographical landscape—specifically its low-lying coastal plain and water conservancy systems—to explain _why_ its adaptation costs are disproportionately high.21

Crucially, Guyana adopted a narrative approach to reporting "support needed." Where precise project-level financial data was unavailable, they provided detailed qualitative descriptions of the needs by sector. This demonstrates to Thailand that the absence of a sophisticated "climate budget tagging" system is not a barrier to submission. Narrative descriptions of financial needs, if sufficiently detailed and logically linked to national circumstances, are acceptable and valuable forms of transparency.23

### 3.3 Iraq: The Honest Assessment of Constraints

Iraq’s submission offers a pragmatic template for countries facing severe data and institutional constraints. As a nation in post-conflict recovery with significant capacity gaps, Iraq’s BTR did not attempt to present a polished façade of perfect data. Instead, it focused on the _process_ of establishing its National Adaptation Plan and M&E frameworks.24

Iraq clearly articulated its "Constraints and Gaps," effectively using the BTR as a needs assessment document to signal to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) where capacity-building support is required. For Thailand, this is a vital lesson in transparency. It is better to clearly state "Data for private sector adaptation in the tourism sector is currently unavailable due to lack of reporting mechanisms" than to present low-confidence estimates. This honesty builds credibility with international reviewers and justifies requests for technical assistance.25

## Section 4: Thailand’s Domestic Context and Sectoral Readiness

### 4.1 The Policy Baseline: From NAP to Implementation

Thailand enters the BTR era with a mature policy landscape but a fragmented implementation tracking system. The apex of this structure is the _National Strategy (2018–2037)_, which integrates climate resilience into national development goals. Beneath this sits the _Climate Change Master Plan (2015–2050)_ and the recently finalized _National Adaptation Plan (NAP)_.7

The NAP is the operational manual for the BTR. It designates six priority sectors that should form the structural backbone of Thailand’s A-BTR. The challenge for the DCCE, as the national focal point, is that the "ownership" of implementation lies with line ministries that may not prioritize climate reporting.

### 4.2 Sectoral Reporting Strategy: A Deep Dive

#### 4.2.1 Agriculture and Food Security

Agency: Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) / Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE).

Context: Agriculture employs over 30% of the workforce but contributes only roughly 8% to GDP, highlighting the extreme socio-economic vulnerability of this sector.8

Reporting Strategy: Thailand has a specific "Climate Change Action Plan for Agriculture (2023-2027)." The BTR should report on specific indicators such as the adoption of the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) standards. Recent studies indicate that while Thai rice farmers are working toward sustainability, SRP scores range from 53% to 81%, providing a quantifiable metric for the BTR.27

Key Data Point: The SCALA project (Scaling up Climate Ambition on Land Use and Agriculture), a partnership with FAO and UNDP, is generating value chain analyses for maize and livestock. This project data is "BTR-ready" and should be highlighted as evidence of international cooperation and implementation progress.8

#### 4.2.2 Water Resources Management

Agency: Office of National Water Resources (ONWR) / Royal Irrigation Department (RID).

Context: Thailand ranks 9th globally in flood risk, with the 2011 floods causing $46.5 billion in damages.28

Reporting Strategy: This sector possesses the most robust quantitative data. The BTR can report on hard infrastructure metrics: storage capacity of new reservoirs (Kaem Ling), kilometers of flood embankments, and the installation of telemetry systems for early warning.

Best Practice Opportunity: Thailand should also report on Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA). Projects involving "living weirs" and floodplain restoration offer a narrative counterpoint to hard infrastructure, demonstrating a sophisticated, diversified approach to resilience.29

#### 4.2.3 Tourism

Agency: Ministry of Tourism and Sports / Department of Tourism.

Context: Tourism is a crucial economic engine but is highly sensitive to climate impacts like coral bleaching and extreme heat.16

Reporting Strategy: This sector suffers from a "data gap." While policies exist to promote "Green Tourism," aggregate data on climate resilience is scarce. The BTR should utilize the "Case Study" approach here. Focusing on specific initiatives, such as the Nan Province watershed management for eco-tourism or the Koh Phi Phi evacuation protocols during Storm Pabuk, allows Thailand to demonstrate action without needing comprehensive national statistics.30

#### 4.2.4 Public Health

Agency: Ministry of Public Health / Department of Health.

Context: The Health National Adaptation Plan (HNAP) 2021–2030 identifies heat stress and vector-borne diseases as key risks.31

Reporting Strategy: The BTR should focus on process indicators derived from the HNAP. Reporting on the establishment of the "Public Health Adaptation to Climate Change Plan Steering Committee" and the integration of climate risk into the surveillance systems for dengue fever provides solid evidence of institutional adaptation. Outcome indicators (e.g., reduced heatstroke mortality) may be premature for the first BTR due to attribution complexities.31

#### 4.2.5 Natural Resources Management

Agency: Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE).

Context: Forestry and coastal resources are critical buffers against climate impacts.

Reporting Strategy: Link adaptation reporting to the REDD+ technical annex (if submitted). Reporting on mangrove restoration projects serves a dual purpose: it is both a carbon sink (mitigation) and a coastal defense (adaptation). This "co-benefit" reporting is highly encouraged by the MPGs and demonstrates policy efficiency.12

#### 4.2.6 Human Settlements

Agency: Department of Public Works and Town & Country Planning.

Context: Urbanization and the aging population create specific vulnerabilities in cities.7

Reporting Strategy: Highlight the Bangkok Master Plan on Climate Change as a sub-national adaptation activity. Reporting on city-level resilience planning is a recognized way to provide granularity in the BTR.33

## Section 5: Best Practices for Beginner Countries

Based on the synthesis of guidance materials and the "Technical Handbook for Developing Countries" 34, the following best practices are recommended for Thailand’s inaugural BTR.

### 5.1 The "Narrative plus Table" Approach

Reviewers and stakeholders struggle to parse dense walls of text. A best practice observed in advanced reports is the use of the Common Tabular Format (CTF) concept for adaptation, even though it is not mandatory.

Recommendation: Thailand should structure Section E (Progress) using a standardized matrix:

- **Column 1:** Climate Hazard (e.g., Drought in Northeast).
    
- **Column 2:** Sector (e.g., Agriculture).
    
- **Column 3:** Adaptation Action (e.g., Distribution of drought-tolerant rice seeds).
    
- **Column 4:** Status (Ongoing/Completed).
    
- Column 5: Indicator/Result (e.g., 5,000 farmers adopted).
    
    This format signals rigorous data management and allows for easy tracking over subsequent BTR cycles.3
    

### 5.2 Leveraging the NAP as the Reporting Backbone

The BTR should not reinvent the wheel; it should be the "progress report" of the NAP.

Recommendation: Structure the BTR’s adaptation chapter to mirror the exact sectoral headings of the NAP 2024. If the NAP has six sectors, the BTR should have six corresponding sub-sections. This creates policy coherence and simplifies the drafting process for the DCCE, as they can map existing NAP M&E data directly into the BTR structure.3

### 5.3 Integrating Cross-Cutting Issues: Gender and Local Wisdom

Modern transparency reports are expected to look beyond biophysical impacts to social dimensions.

Recommendation: Explicitly report on gender-responsive adaptation. For example, when reporting on agricultural training, disaggregate the beneficiary data by sex. Furthermore, Thailand should highlight "Local Wisdom" (Poom Panya Thong Thin) in water management. Reporting on how traditional knowledge is integrated into modern adaptation plans fulfills the specific MPG requirement to report on "traditional, indigenous, and local knowledge," adding depth and cultural context to the report.5

### 5.4 The "Climate Rationale" Linkage

A best practice identified by the GCF and adaptation experts is ensuring a clear "climate rationale" for reported actions.

Recommendation: Do not simply list "construction of a dam" as adaptation. This could be standard development. The report must state: "Construction of a dam designed to withstand the projected 15% increase in peak precipitation intensity." This explicit linkage between the action and the climate hazard is what distinguishes adaptation reporting from general development reporting.34

## Section 6: Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

The analysis of early BTR technical reviews and the transition from NCs reveals recurrent errors that beginner countries make. Avoiding these will save Thailand time and reputational capital.

### 6.1 Pitfall 1: The "Paper Plan" Syndrome

Countries often report the existence of a plan or law as the primary evidence of adaptation, without providing evidence of implementation.

The Trap: Listing the "Climate Change Act" or "National Strategy" as the sole content of the "Progress" section.

The Mitigation: Always follow a policy statement with an activity statement. "The National Committee on Climate Change was established (Policy). In 2024, it approved three major flood diversion projects in the Chao Phraya basin with a budget of X Baht (Activity)." Move reporting from outputs (documents) to outcomes (decisions/investments).15

### 6.2 Pitfall 2: The "Black Box" of Private Sector Data

Government-centric reporting frequently ignores the vast adaptation actions undertaken by the private sector, leading to an underestimation of national resilience.

The Trap: Reporting only on public budget expenditure, ignoring that tourism operators are building sea walls or farmers are investing in new machinery.

The Mitigation: Thailand should engage the Joint Standing Committee on Commerce, Industry and Banking (JSCCIB) to gather qualitative data on private sector initiatives. Even if a dollar figure cannot be verified, describing these trends provides a more holistic picture of national adaptation.8

### 6.3 Pitfall 3: Disconnect Between Needs and Reporting

A common critique is that the "Adaptation" chapter describes success while the "Support Needed" chapter describes failure, creating a narrative conflict.

The Trap: The adaptation section claims the country is "successfully managing flood risks," while the support section requests billions for flood management without context.

The Mitigation: Align the narratives. "While Thailand has successfully piloted flood management in Region A (Adaptation Chapter), scaling this to Regions B and C requires estimated support of $500M USD (Support Chapter)." The BTR should be viewed as an investment prospectus, logically connecting successful pilots to the need for scaling finance.11

### 6.4 Pitfall 4: Neglecting the "Learning" in MEL

Countries often treat M&E as purely "monitoring" (counting things) and neglect "evaluation" (learning what works).

The Trap: Presenting tables of numbers without analysis of effectiveness or failure.

The Mitigation: Include a narrative section on "Lessons Learned." Discussing what didn't work (e.g., a specific crop variety that failed in high heat) is valuable technical information and demonstrates a mature, transparent learning process.40

---

## Section 7: A Developmental Roadmap for Thailand (2025–2030)

Thailand should not aim for a "perfect" BTR in the first cycle. The ETF is designed for continuous improvement. A phased "Ladder of Reliability" approach is recommended to manage capacity constraints while showing progress over time.

### Phase 1: The Foundation (2024/2025 Submission)

- **Objective:** Compliance and Baseline Setting.
    
- **Methodology:** Qualitative Narrative & Process Indicators.
    
- **Key Actions:**
    
    - Map the existing NAP sectors to the BTR structure.
        
    - Inventory all relevant policies and committees (National Circumstances).
        
    - Report _process_ indicators (e.g., "Number of vulnerability assessments completed," "Budget allocated to ONWR").
        
    - Utilize high-quality case studies (e.g., The SCALA project results) to demonstrate depth where breadth is missing.
        
    - Clearly articulate "Constraints and Gaps" to flag areas for future improvement.6
        

### Phase 2: Consolidation (2026/2027 Submission)

- **Objective:** Quantitative Tracking and Finance Linkages.
    
- **Methodology:** Output Indicators & Climate Budget Tagging.
    
- **Key Actions:**
    
    - Operationalize the DCCE’s M&E system across line ministries, requiring annual reporting on specific output indicators (e.g., "Hectares of agricultural land under sustainable management").
        
    - Work with the Bureau of Budget to implement a "Climate Budget Tagging" system. This allows the BTR to report an aggregate figure for "Domestic Adaptation Finance," a powerful metric for the Global Stocktake.
        
    - Integrate Loss and Damage data from the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (DDPM) to substantiate the economic cost of climate impacts.15
        

### Phase 3: Advanced Impact (2028+ Submissions)

- **Objective:** Impact Assessment and Global Leadership.
    
- **Methodology:** Outcome/Impact Indicators & Private Sector Integration.
    
- **Key Actions:**
    
    - Move from tracking outputs (dams built) to outcomes (flood damages avoided). This requires longitudinal scientific studies and modeling.
        
    - Formalize data-sharing agreements with the private sector (tourism associations, agricultural conglomerates) to include their data in the national report.
        
    - Position Thailand as a regional knowledge hub, reporting on South-South cooperation and technology transfer to neighboring CLMV (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam) countries.

## Section 8: Conclusion

The submission of the first Biennial Transparency Report is a watershed moment for Thailand’s climate policy. It represents the transition from the era of _planning_—defined by the NAP and Master Plans—to the era of _transparency and implementation_.

For a beginner country, the task is daunting but manageable if approached strategically. By understanding that the MPGs offer flexibility, Thailand can craft a report that fits its current data reality while setting a clear trajectory for improvement. The key is to avoid the trap of "paper compliance." A BTR that honestly assesses gaps, highlights specific successes through case studies, and clearly links adaptation actions to financial needs is far more valuable than a report that attempts to hide data scarcity behind vague generalizations.

Ultimately, the Adaptation Chapter of the BTR is a tool for trust. By transparently reporting on its vulnerabilities and its resilience efforts, Thailand does not just fulfill a UN requirement; it builds the credibility necessary to attract the global support required to safeguard its future. The roadmap outlined here—moving from narrative baselines to quantitative impacts—ensures that Thailand’s reporting evolves in lockstep with its resilience.
