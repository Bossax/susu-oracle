# Key Components and Elements of RMF

1. **Logic Models**: The RMF is underpinned by **mitigation and adaptation logic models**. These models illustrate how inputs and activities are expected to translate into strategic-level results, aiming for an overall "paradigm shift objective" towards low-emission and climate-resilient sustainable development.
    
    - The **mitigation logic model** identifies nine result areas, with four reflecting intended aggregate Fund-level impact and five representing project/programme-level outcomes.
    - The **adaptation logic model** consists of four Fund-level impact areas and four project/programme-level outcome areas.
    - There is also a separate logic model for **REDD+ results-based payments**, focusing on reducing emissions through land use, deforestation, forest degradation, sustainable management, conservation, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.

2. **Indicator Menu**: The RMF offers a flexible menu of **43 core, impact, and outcome indicators** across mitigation, adaptation, and REDD+. These indicators are further detailed in the **Performance Measurement Frameworks (PMFs)**, which serve as an extension of the RMF.
    
    - **Core Mitigation Indicators**:
        - Tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2eq) reduced as a result of Fund-funded activities.
        - Cost per tCO2eq decreased for all Fund-funded mitigation projects/programmes.
        - Volume of finance leveraged by Fund funding.

    - **Core Adaptation Indicator**:
        - Total number of direct and indirect beneficiaries; and number of beneficiaries relative to total population.
    
    - **Cross-cutting projects** are required to inform both mitigation and adaptation core indicators.
    
    - The RMF **does not prescribe output indicators**, allowing project stakeholders to choose and design appropriate ones for flexibility and specificity.
    

## Relationship with Other Board-Approved Frameworks:

The RMF's operationalization is supported by other Board-approved frameworks that provide further guidance for project preparation, management, and reporting. These include:

- **Investment Framework (IF)**: Contains six investment criteria (e.g., impact potential, paradigm shift potential, country ownership, efficiency and effectiveness) that all GCF investments must meet. The 'impact potential' criterion directly incorporates core and impact level indicators from the RMF's PMFs.
- **Monitoring and Accountability Framework (MAF)**: Provides guidance on responsibilities, tools, and processes for ==monitoring and reporting results from GCF investments==. It defines the roles of Accredited Entities (AEs) for monitoring and reporting via Annual Progress Reports (APRs), and the Secretariat's role in managing the system.
- **Risk Management Framework**: Establishes roles, responsibilities, and procedures for managing risks within the organization, though the RMF itself is silent on this.

# Adaptation Logic Model

 It illustrates the expected cause-effect linkages from inputs and activities to strategic-level results, ultimately aiming for an overall "paradigm shift objective" towards climate-resilient sustainable development.

## Key Components and Elements
**Initial RMF**
1. Structure 
    - It consists of **four Fund-level impact areas** and **four project/programme-level outcome areas**. These result areas are intended to guide project design and account for portfolio results.
    - **Fund-level Impact Areas** include:
        1. Increased resilience and enhanced livelihoods of the most vulnerable people, communities, and regions.
        2. Increased resilience of health and well-being, and food and water security.
        3. Increased resilience of infrastructure and the built environment to climate change threats.
        4. Improved resilience of ecosystems and ecosystem services.
        
    - **Project/Programme-level Outcome Areas** include:
        1. Strengthened institutional and regulatory systems for climate-responsive planning and development.
        2. Increased generation and use of climate information in decision-making.
        3. Strengthened adaptive capacity and reduced exposure to climate risks.
        4. Strengthened awareness of climate threats and risk-reduction processes.
        
2. Core Adaptation Indicator
    - The single Board-approved Fund-level core impact indicator for adaptation projects is the **"Total number of direct and indirect beneficiaries; and number of beneficiaries relative to total population"**.



**Updates in the Integrated Results Management Framework (IRMF):**

The IRMF, applicable to projects submitted from the Board's thirty-second meeting (B.32) onwards, builds on the initial RMF. While retaining the eight results areas for adaptation, it updates and refines the core indicators:

# Core Adaptation Indicator 

Under the **initial RMF**, the Board-approved Fund-level core impact indicator for adaptation projects and programmes is the 
1. **Core indicator 1**
	1. Total number of direct and indirect beneficiaries
	2.  Number of beneficiaries relative to total population 
This indicator is required for adaptation projects and programmes.

With the **Integrated Results Management Framework (IRMF)**, which applies to projects submitted to the Board from its thirty-second meeting (B.32) onwards, the core indicator most directly related to increased resilience (adaptation) is 
2. **Core indicator 2**: Direct and indirect beneficiaries reached 
	This indicator measures the "number of individuals" and is disaggregated by sex (female and male) and results area.

The IRMF also includes other core indicators that can apply to adaptation efforts:
3. **Core indicator 3**:  Value of physical assets made more resilient to the effects of climate change and/or more able to reduce GHG emissions
4. Core indicator 4: Hectares of natural resource areas brought under improved low-emission and/or climate-resilient management practices

# Challenges and gaps

many projects are not well rationalized and measured (40%)

- **Lack of Clear Definitions and Guidance**: There is a **critical absence of definitions and protocols for RMF indicators**, leading to confusion and inconsistent guidance. For instance, "paradigm-shift objectives" are described rather than defined as measurable indicators, and there's no guidance on how to measure these indicators, by whom, or with what frequency. The core adaptation indicator, "Total number of direct and indirect beneficiaries," lacks protocol on how beneficiaries are identified or measured. This overall lack of measurement protocols means indicators are not consistently compiled or informed.

- **Flaws in Logic Models**: The RMF provides **insufficient guidance on how project outcomes contribute to long-term paradigm shifts** because of flaws in its underlying logic models.
    - The mitigation logic model omits critical enabling conditions for a paradigm shift, such as access to finance, appropriate business models, technology, and information.
    - The adaptation model neglects technology, financial/business models, and private sector contributions. Its core objective, "increased climate-resilient sustainable development," is undefined.
    - ==More than two-thirds of approved proposals did not clearly define **causal pathways** showing how activities lead to climate change impact, indicating issues with logical coherence.==

- **Marginalization of the RMF**: The RMF has been **marginalized in its use by the GCF Secretariat and project stakeholders**. Instead, other Board-approved frameworks, such as the Investment Framework, Monitoring and Accountability Framework (MAF), and Risk Management Framework, receive far more attention and compliance. Specialists within the Secretariat often don't see much utility in the RMF beyond selecting impact and result areas.

- **Inconsistent Internal Guidance and Incentives**:
    - Due to a lack of unified guidance, **different Secretariat divisions have developed their own interpretations** of results management criteria, leading to inconsistent requirements for Accredited Entities (AEs).
    - The Secretariat's approval and implementation structure **does not incentivize incorporating results management frameworks early in project design**, as divisions hand over projects once initial disbursements occur, leading to a lack of continuity in results management. This means M&E system design and budgeting do not receive sufficient attention during project preparation.
    
- **Insufficient M&E Planning and Budgeting**: A **large proportion of projects (40%, or US$1,363 million) lack indicators for planned impacts**, posing a significant reputational risk.
    - **Half of approved projects do not plan to collect baseline data**.
    - **70% of projects have insufficiently planned and budgeted for M&E** to credibly inform their targets. Many M&E plans are skeletal, lacking detail on how indicators will be tracked or how monitoring will inform future activities.

- **Complexity of Cross-Cutting Projects**: Projects classified as cross-cutting are **most likely to lack impact indicators** for their targeted results, affecting over 70% of these proposals. The RMF provides insufficient guidance for differentiating investments in cross-cutting projects into adaptation or mitigation components, hindering accurate tracking of fund allocation commitments.
- **Difficulty with Adaptation Indicators**: Adaptation projects are **more prone to omitting impact indicators** than mitigation projects. This is particularly challenging in areas where distinguishing climate change resilience from regular sustainable development is difficult, and devising clear indicators is complex.


- The RMF often presents impact indicators that are difficult to operationalize and use.

	
- The quality at entry of funding proposals shows significant deficiencies in M&E planning.
- 
- **Marginalization and Inconsistency of PMF Use**
    
    - The PMF has been somewhat **marginalized in its use by the GCF Secretariat and project stakeholders**. Other Board-approved frameworks, such as the Investment Framework (IF) and Monitoring and Accountability Framework (MAF), receive far more attention.
    - Secretariat staff often use alternative guidance or develop their own interpretations to fill gaps in the RMF, leading to inconsistent messages to AEs and varying standards.
    - **Cross-cutting projects are most likely to underreport** on their results; 70% of cross-cutting funding proposals are affected, with 13 out of 18 projects missing at least one impact indicator for their targeted areas.
    - While the RMF emphasizes impact and outcome indicators, annual APR reporting tends to focus heavily on activity and output-level progress because high-level indicators do not change significantly year-to-year, making annual reporting on them less meaningful.

- **Operational and Structural Deficiencies**
    - There is no system within the GCF Secretariat to consolidate and aggregate reported information across entities** effectively, which can lead to **double counting** and challenges in **demonstrating overall Fund impact**.
    - The roles and responsibilities in monitoring and reporting, particularly for AEs and National Designated Authorities (NDAs), are not sufficiently clear in practice, leading to inefficiencies and tensions.
    - Project monitoring frameworks and plans are often submitted late in the project development cycle, leaving insufficient time for review and necessary changes before Board approval.
    - The risk management framework does not explicitly mention or link to the RMF, despite its relevance to results achievement.
    - The accreditation process for AEs may have deficiencies in screening for robust monitoring, reporting, and evaluation capacities, contributing to the poor quality of proposals and results management.
    - ==There is a missed opportunity to link GCF project monitoring systems with existing national monitoring and reporting systems, including those tied to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which could enhance consistency and reduce reporting burdens.==
