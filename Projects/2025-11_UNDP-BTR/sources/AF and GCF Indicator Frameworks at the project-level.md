The Adaptation Fund (AF) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) both employ core indicator frameworks to assess project progress and results, though their specific foci and methodologies differ.

# Adaptation Fund (AF) Core Indicator Framework

The AF's guidance document assists project proponents in defining and measuring core indicators to assess project-level progress in increasing adaptive capacity to climate change impacts.

- **Principles/Rationale:** The indicators aim to proxy the increase in adaptive capacity by measuring inputs of support, rather than directly measuring success in reducing climate change impacts or increasing resilience. Early warning is critical for disaster risk reduction. Assets are improved to respond to climate change variability. Increased income reflects strengthened livelihoods against climate change impacts. Natural assets protected provide adapted natural resources and indicate ecosystem health.
- **Core Indicators:**
    - **Number of Beneficiaries:** Measures people receiving direct assistance for climate change impacts, categorized as "Direct" (targeted and high intensity support) or "Indirect" (targeted/not targeted and medium intensity support). Disaggregated by gender and youth.
    - **Early Warning Systems (EWS):** Assesses the implementation and functionality of EWS, comprising risk knowledge, monitoring and warning service, dissemination, and response capability. Reported by EWS category, hazard targeted, geographical coverage, and number of municipalities.
    - **Assets Produced, Developed, Improved, or Strengthened:** Covers development sector services and physical infrastructure designed to increase resilience to climate change. Changes are reported quantitatively (absolute numbers in metric system) or qualitatively (1-5 scale).
    - **Increased income, or avoided decrease in income:** Focuses on strengthening household income sources in relation to climate change impacts, defining parameters like total and targeted households, and types/levels of income sources.
    - **Natural Assets Protected or Rehabilitated:** Measures changes in biological assets, land, and water areas with their ecosystems, indicating availability of adapted natural resources and ecosystem health. Reported quantitatively (absolute numbers in metric system) or qualitatively (1-5 scale) for effectiveness.
- **Reporting:** Indicators are reported at project approval, first year of implementation, and project completion stages. Baselines are often set at 0 as no support was provided before the project. Data sources include national systems, censuses, and project-specific surveys.

# Green Climate Fund (GCF) Approach to M&E

The GCF's M&E at the project level is guided by its **Readiness Results Management Framework (RRMF)** for its **Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme** (RPSP) and by **Investment Criteria Indicators** for its broader funding proposals.

- **Project-Level Logical Framework:**
    - Requests for readiness support utilize a logical framework that closely matches identified needs and gaps within a country. This framework is an opportunity for National Designated Authorities (NDAs) and their partners to communicate how proposed activities address readiness levels, gaps, and future priorities.
    - **Outcomes:** These refer to key results necessary for accessing GCF finance, delivering and implementing GCF projects and programs, and monitoring, reporting, and verifying finance flows. Proposals must use specific, Board-approved outcomes linked to the five Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme (RPSP) objectives.
    - **Baselines and Targets:** For each outcome, a brief description of the current state (baseline) and the expected progress or observable changes (target) resulting from the readiness support are provided.
    - **Outputs and Activities:** Activities are linked to relevant outputs, which in turn contribute to outcomes. Specific and tangible deliverables accompany the activities.
    
- **Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme (RPSP) Objectives:** The RPSP itself is structured around **five key objectives** to assess the contributions of readiness grants:
    1. **Capacity Building (Objective 1):** Focuses on establishing human, technical, and institutional systems for GCF recipient countries and stakeholders to fulfill their roles and responsibilities.
    2. **Strategic Frameworks (Objective 2):** Aims for robust strategic frameworks to guide GCF investment in complementarity with other climate financiers.
    3. **National Adaptation Plans and Adaptation Planning Processes (Objective 3):** Supports the formulation of NAPs and other adaptation planning processes.
    4. **Pipeline Development (Objective 4):** Aims to develop a pipeline of projects for paradigm shifts.
    5. **Knowledge Sharing and Learning (Objective 5):** Focuses on developing and disseminating best practices.

In this context, **"investment" refers to the financial support provided by the GCF**.
Specifically, the GCF makes **investments in projects and programmes**. These projects and programmes are designed and proposed by **Accredited Entities (AEs)**. The investment criteria indicators guide AEs in developing proposals, explaining how their proposed project can catalyze impact beyond a one-off investment. The GCF contribution is part of the total project funding, often alongside co-financing.
## Investment Criteria Indicators
adopted by the Board. These criteria guide GCF stakeholders, including Accredited Entities (AEs) when developing project/programme proposals. They **are not used to screen out proposals** or as a pass/fail test, but rather to support AEs in describing how their funding proposal delivers against them.

>[!info] Used by project proponent
>- Guide their development of project/programme proposals.
>- Clearly describe how the project is expected to deliver against the relevant investment criteria.
>- Enhance the quality of funding proposals by increasing clarity on how they meet the GCF investment criteria.
>- Provide a mechanism to explain performance that is relatively higher or lower than expected.

The criteria are:
1. **Impact potential**: This assesses the expected reductions in emissions for mitigation projects or the expected change in loss of lives, assets, livelihoods, and/or environmental/social losses for adaptation projects, including the number of beneficiaries.
2. **Paradigm shift potential**: This evaluates a project's vision for catalysing impact beyond a one-off investment, including a theory of change for replication and/or scaling up, and long-term sustainability of results.
3. **Sustainable development potential**: This requires identifying at least one positive co-benefit with associated indicators, baselines, and target values in at least two of four coverage areas: economic, social, environmental, and gender empowerment. Proposals may also reference the ability to achieve Sustainable Development Goals.
4. **Needs of the recipient**: This describes the country’s financial, economic, social, and institutional needs and barriers to accessing climate-related finance, and how the proposed intervention addresses them.
5. **Country ownership**: This examines how the proposed activities align with a country’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and other relevant national plans, and the degree of support from national policy/institutional frameworks. It also requires explaining engagement with relevant stakeholders, including national designated authorities.
6. **Efficiency and effectiveness**: For mitigation projects, this involves indicators like cost per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, ratio of co-financing mobilized relative to the GCF contribution, and expected rates of return (economic or financial internal rate of return). For both mitigation and adaptation, it assesses how the proposal applies and builds on best practices in the sector.



- **Logical Chain / Theory of Change (ToC):**
    - The RPSP's underlying logical chain (ToC) illustrates how its activities are intended to achieve broader goals. The ultimate goal is to facilitate climate action finance at scale.
    - This chain progresses from **capacity building** (Objective 1) as the foundation, which enables the development of **country programs and strategic frameworks** (Objective 2) and **National Adaptation Plans (NAPs)** (Objective 3). These, in turn, form the basis for **Concept Note (CN) and Funding Proposal development** (Objective 4), leading to climate finance mobilization. Knowledge sharing (Objective 5) supports and links all components.
    
- **Overarching Impact Measurement (GCF Level):**
    - The RPSP's impact is defined as the **flow of climate finance** to countries, including GCF funding, other climate financiers, co-financing, and private sector investments. It contributes to building the preconditions for accessing climate finance at various steps along its logical chain.
    - For GCF's overall investment framework, key indicators include **project lifetime emission reductions** for mitigation and **expected change in loss of lives, physical assets, livelihoods, and environmental/social losses** for adaptation, along with the **number of direct and indirect beneficiaries**.
    - The GCF aims to finance transformational investments in mitigation and adaptation projects and programs based on developing countries' needs and priorities.
    
- **Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) Common Approach (Broader Context):**
    - MDBs, including the GCF, are working towards a "Common Approach to Measuring Climate Results" to enhance consistency and provide a clearer view of climate outcomes.
    - This approach is framed across three levels:
        - **Level 1: Global and Country Context:** Includes indicators for global climate adaptation and resilience, such as the percentage of people at high risk from climate shocks globally, and global GHG emissions and atmospheric concentration.
        - **Level 2: Results from Operations:** Focuses on expected outputs and outcomes from MDB operations at the time of commitment. This level includes adaptation and resilience results (thematic areas reflecting people, planet, economy) and mitigation results (GHG emissions and sectoral indicators).
        - **Level 3: Institutional Efforts:** Indicators capturing MDBs' institutional efforts will be developed later.
    

**Principles of the Indicators:**
- **Results-Oriented:** The RRMF is designed to assess the outcomes and impact-level results of readiness grants by defining indicators for five key objectives: capacity building, strategic framework development, national adaptation planning, pipeline development, and knowledge sharing.
- **Guiding, Not Screening:** The investment criteria indicators are intended to **guide GCF stakeholders** (the Board, Independent Technical Advisory Panel, Secretariat, and Accredited Entities) when developing and reviewing proposals. They are explicitly stated **not to be used as a binary pass/fail test** or a single threshold that must be passed.
- **Context-Specific Application:** The application of these indicators must **consider the differing national circumstances** of developing countries, particularly those vulnerable to climate change. This means a project might be less strong on one criterion but stronger on another, and both should be considered together.
- **Consistency and Transparency:** The indicators aim to provide more consistency and transparency in funding proposal documents, making their preparation and assessment more efficient.
- **Results-Based Framework for Readiness:** For readiness grants, a **results-based framework with quantitative indicators** is used to track and monitor progress and evaluate performance against specified targets over time. Baselines and targets should be grounded in tangible terms, such as surveys or regular follow-ups, rather than just meeting minutes.

**Intended Purpose of the Indicators:**
- **Enhance Accountability and Inform Programming:** For the RPSP, indicators are crucial for ensuring accountability to GCF results and informing the continued programming of the RPSP.
- **Improve Proposal Quality:** They aim to enhance the quality of funding proposals over time by increasing clarity on how they meet GCF investment criteria and by flagging areas requiring additional explanations.
- **Measure Diverse Impacts and Contributions:**
    - **Impact Potential:** For mitigation, this is measured by project lifetime emission reductions. For adaptation, it assesses the expected change in losses (lives, physical assets, livelihoods, environmental/social) and the number of direct and indirect beneficiaries.
    - **Paradigm Shift Potential:** Indicators seek to identify a vision for catalytic impact beyond a single investment, including a theory of change for replication, scaling up, and long-term sustainability, or how key constraints will be addressed.
    - **Sustainable Development Potential:** They measure positive co-benefits in economic (e.g., job creation, poverty alleviation), social (e.g., health, education, social inclusion), environmental (e.g., air/water quality, biodiversity), and gender empowerment areas, often disaggregated by gender and referencing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
    - **Needs of the Recipient:** Indicators describe how proposals address country-specific financial, economic, social, and institutional needs and barriers to accessing climate finance.
    - **Country Ownership:** They assess alignment with Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), national plans, and existing policy frameworks, as well as the degree of stakeholder engagement.
    - **Efficiency and Effectiveness:** These indicators evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mitigation (e.g., cost per tonne of CO2e, co-financing ratio, rate of return) and the application of best practices across both mitigation and adaptation projects.

# Adaptation Fund (AF) Approach to M&E 

The AF adopts a **Results-Based Management (RBM)** framework, which is centered on a **results chain** that illustrates the causal relationship from activities to outputs, outcomes, and ultimately impact over time.

**Principles of the Indicators:**
- **Causal Linkages:** RBM is built on a clear understanding of how project interventions contribute to desired outcomes, with a logical flow from inputs to outputs, then to short- and medium-term outcomes, and finally to long-term impact and the overall goal.
- **Alignment with Fund Strategy:** Projects are required to align their objectives with the AF's Strategic Results Framework, ensuring direct contribution to the Fund's overall goal of reducing vulnerability and increasing adaptive capacity.
- **Participatory Development:** Indicator selection involves representatives from implementing agencies, government, beneficiaries, and other stakeholders, fostering consensus and ownership.
- **Selection Criteria:** Indicators are assessed for their suitability and effectiveness based on criteria such as validity (measuring the result), precision (clear meaning), practicality (affordable, easy to collect), reliability (consistent over time), sensitivity (susceptible to change), clarity (interpretable as good/bad), usefulness for decision-making, and stakeholder ownership. Both quantitative and qualitative indicators are utilized.
- **Baseline-Driven Targets:** Realistic targets are set for each indicator based on actual baseline values, which measure conditions at the project's inception, enabling accurate measurement of progress.

**Intended Purpose of the Indicators:**
- **Assess Project Progress and Effectiveness:** Indicators are primarily designed to measure implementation progress and the achievement of results at the project level, assessing whether a project is meeting its objectives.
- **Guide Reporting:** They serve as the basis for annual project performance reports (PPRs), mid-term, and final evaluations, which are submitted throughout the project lifecycle to chart progress and assess overall judgments about results.
- **Standardized Core Impact Measurement:** The AF has a menu of standard core indicators to facilitate comparable data aggregation across similar projects to the Fund-wide level. These include:
    - **Number of Beneficiaries:** Measures the number of people receiving direct assistance to cope with climate change impacts, disaggregated by category (direct/indirect) and gender.
    - **Early Warning Systems (EWS):** Tracks the number and type of EWS components (risk knowledge, monitoring, dissemination, response capability) developed and their geographical coverage for disaster risk reduction.
    - **Assets Produced, Developed, Improved, or Strengthened:** Assesses the extent to which projects improve or create physical infrastructure and development sector services to increase climate resilience.
    - **Increased income, or avoided decrease in income:** Measures the strengthening of household livelihoods and income sources in response to climate change impacts.
    - **Natural Assets Protected or Rehabilitated:** Provides information on the availability and health of adapted natural resources (e.g., land, water, forests) in the face of climate change.
- **Inform Learning and Adaptative Management:** The RBM framework is intended to improve learning by analyzing results to adjust delivery and modify or confirm project and programme design. Data collection methods vary to provide appropriate information for different levels of the logical framework, balancing data quality, cost, and time.
- **Assess Sustainability:** M&E also assesses the likelihood of achieved outcomes continuing after the project ends, considering financial, socio-political, institutional, and environmental risks.

### Analogy

Think of M&E at the project level for these climate funds like two different approaches to navigating a long and complex journey.

**GCF's M&E** is like a high-level strategic planner using a **"dashboard" with comprehensive indicators**. It ensures that your journey aligns with your broader life goals (paradigm shift, sustainable development) and that you are addressing various challenges (country needs, barriers) along the way. The indicators are like **guiding principles** for your journey – they tell you if you're making a significant, lasting impact, if you're being efficient with your resources, and if you're involving the right people, rather than just checking if you've completed a single leg of the trip. The purpose is to ensure the whole journey contributes to a **transformational life path**.

**AF's M&E**, on the other hand, is like a **meticulous navigator with a "checklist" for each segment of the journey**. It breaks down the trip into concrete, measurable steps (outputs, outcomes) and ensures that each step directly contributes to your primary objective of reaching a specific safe harbor (increased adaptive capacity). The indicators are like **specific, detailed measurements** for each leg – how many miles driven, how much fuel consumed, what condition the road is in, and who is on board. The purpose is to **precisely track and prove** that each intervention is delivering its intended, measurable results for climate resilience.
