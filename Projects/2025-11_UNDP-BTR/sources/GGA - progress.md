# The work on set of indicators

solidify ways of measuring progress
not much evidence on how effective measurement is
is the effort transformational?
depend on systematic way of collecting and analyzing data + context specificity

[[Projects/2025-11_UNDP-BTR/sources/UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience]]
- 7 thematic areas

## *Progress*
1. 64 submissions of indicators from member parties
	- 9000 indicators
2. series of negotiations spanning from 2024 to Nov 2025 (COP 30)
	1. adding criteria
		1. aggregation
		2. scope
	2. adding more dimensions to consideration
3. Now the indicators are narrowed down to 100 (final proposal) check technical report (sep 2025) for the 2 CMA 2.5 decision of indicator use cases
## Convergence of a common approach 
Target language and indicators must match

> Have we solidify the target language??
> Sounds like indicators for target tracking


Gaps
- what have not been measured? why? 

For example: Food and agriculture system
- impact pathway (result area) diagram 
	- interplay between hazard, exposure, and vulnerability that leads to an impact
	- less deterministic in a sense that it is not a rigid "pathway"

points
- make sure not adding too much burden on countries
- use existing indicators with slight modifications
- GGA indicators must be adaptation focused since we have other sets of indicators that are not exactly adaptation focused

# Bhutan case
http://www.nec.gov.bt/

climate performance

activity-based adaptation M&E 

make use of existing institutional arrangement

frame adaptation as not climate mut economic policy
- what is the framing? 

# Sri Lanka's case

Developing targets based on GGA and reporting the progress

Provincial adaptation plan (9 provinces)


# Bangladesh's case

Financing
ERD is responsible for accessing international climate funds
https://erd.gov.bd/


Objective
- GGA gaps
- Economic growth: growth is useless if it is not redistributed equally
	- price of inequality


capacity gaps among the countries
- resilience and vulnerability metrics

fragmentation

Mitigation and adaptation
4 million USD spent
25 Ministries 

# Korea's case

mechanisms to minimize duplication and collect data

- strengthening existing mechanisms

KACC spearheads adaptation effort
research and policy dev, imp, M&E

Korea has been able to use the existing national M&E system to collect data and report through BTR

don't focus much on reports much channeling the resources to implementation on the ground

>[!quote]
>Evaluation activities in Korea are heavily influenced by the central government policies. The Korean government established extensive government-wide evaluation systems. The central ministries, the PMO and MoEF manage comprehensive sets of performance evaluation and management sytems for government policies and budgetary programs. Sectoral ministries and special committees run their own evaluation systems for sectoral policies and programs. Almost all the evaluation systems have legal bases. The NABO, a research institute in the Natioanl Assembly and the BAI, a supreme audit office, also conduct evaluations on public policies and programs. Evaluation services are usually provided by the public research institute and university professors, while civil society organizations are often invited to the advisory evaluation committees. Since there are many PhD researchers and professors in social sciences in Korea, the field of evaluation is not well established as its own and is developed as a part of other social scientific disciplines.

# My reflection

If communities are not safe, reporting is useless. 
empowerment for adaptive capacity 
community must be equipped with resources to continuously adapt the the changing reality to avoid maladaptation

GGA indictors and reporting should not be a burden. Contextualization is important 

qualitative indicators are important when engaging with the community

regional level, tracking effectiveness of implementation
at the national level tracking  resource allocation

coherence: learning from bottom up processes qualitative evidence matching with top down guidance

starting point: people's reality  => this is  perceived risk, microeconomic adaptation, and incentive structure 
translating jargons to the lived experience 
engagement approach 
support the community to "capture" the evidence on their own.
whether the assessment we do at the high level matches with the local experience

> This area is really under developed in Thailand. There is no feedback loop.


# UN
Key entry points
How UN can help countries

100 indicators
- output indicators depend on "national definition"
	- integrated water resource management plan -> what does it include at the country level
	- to include climate change adaptation?
- outcome indicator
	- require climate baseline
	- establish the current baseline
	- macro related heat-related injury or death
		- demographic included in the change detection

These will be heavily technical 
definitions are so important

# Q: support for transformational adaptation? who brings this change?

Enabling environment
All sources of funding must build resilience or not undermine it
We need really strong citizen movement
citizen budgeting

assumption about risk
what level of risk we are willing to accept? set the bar
