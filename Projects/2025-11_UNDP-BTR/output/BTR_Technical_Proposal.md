# 2. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY, APPROACH, AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## 2.1 Our understanding of the requirement

Creagy fully understands that the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) requires a comprehensive **_Adaptation Chapter_** for Thailand’s combined Fifth National Communication and Second Biennial Transparency Report (5NC/2BTR). This assignment is not merely about writing a report; it is about strengthening Thailand’s capacity for transparent, evidence-based adaptation planning and reporting in line with UNFCCC requirements.

Thailand, as a Party to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, must regularly communicate its climate change adaptation efforts under the Paris Agreement’s **_Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF_).** The Adaptation Chapter will thus compile up-to-date information on climate impacts, vulnerabilities, and adaptation measures up to 2024, ensuring Thailand meets its international reporting obligations with high-quality data. A robust and transparent adaptation report is crucial to build mutual trust under the ETF and to inform the **_Global Stocktake_**, demonstrating progress toward the **_Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA)._**

This assignment has a broad scope that links **_national adaptation actions_** with **_international reporting standards_**. It involves

·         A review and update of Thailand’s climate change adaptation information and National Adaptation Plan (NAP) implementation status (up to end of 2024),

·         The development of granular risk maps and a climate hazard database at sub-provincial level

·         The baseline framework and Data Reference Sheet for a spatial Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) system

·         Drafting and finalizing the Adaptation Chapter for the 5NC/2BTR.

Together, these components will establish an integrated adaptation cycle covering from planning and implementation to monitoring, evaluation, and reporting.

This _integrated cycle_ aims to improve decision-making and the effectiveness of adaptation measures in Thailand by grounding them in data and analysis. Creagy recognizes that the Adaptation Chapter must be comprehensive and aligned with UNFCCC Modalities, Procedures, and Guidelines (MPGs) (Decision 18/CMA.1) for adaptation reporting. It must cover all required elements – including national circumstances, climate impacts and vulnerabilities, adaptation goals and actions, progress on implementation, monitoring & evaluation of adaptation, information on losses and damages, and good practices and lessons learned – clearly and transparently.

Equally important is **_contextual understanding_**. Thailand’s NAP outlines priority sectors (e.g. water, agriculture, public health, etc.), and significant progress has been made in each. Our team understands the critical importance of reflecting the **_NAP progress and adaptation commitments_** up to 2024 in this chapter. The chapter will thereby serve as a bridge between Thailand’s domestic adaptation efforts and its international reporting, ensuring consistency with National Communications, NDCs, and Adaptation Communications under the Paris Agreement (Article 7). Ultimately, Creagy’s proposal is driven by the recognition that **_transparent adaptation reporting_** is not just a compliance exercise, but a tool to enhance national resilience. By clearly documenting what adaptation actions have been taken, what results have been achieved, and what gaps remain, Thailand can better plan future actions and attract support.

Creagy is committed to delivering an Adaptation Chapter that is **_credible and actionable_**, laying the groundwork for sustained climate resilience. We will ensure that **_gender equality and the needs_** of vulnerable groups are integrated throughout the analysis – from assessing differentiated vulnerabilities to highlighting inclusive adaptation practices.

In summary, the outcome of this assignment will help Thailand overcome the challenges when building climate resilience and become **_more prepared for the next adaptation implementation and reporting cycle_**_._

The objectives and scopes of the key assignments in this project are:

**Task 1 Compilation and Update of Thailand’s Adaptation Information (NAP Progress up to 2024)**

**1.**       **_The planning on climate change adaptation implementation and reporting cycle_**: Review the best global practices, guidelines, and standards to propose a national climate change adaptation cycle. The cycle will consist of well-defined stages, key activities of each stage, mechanisms to execute the activities, and institutional arrangements. This cycle aims to be adopted by the Department of Climate Change and Environment to enhance their reporting routines and drive the integration of the adaptation stages into relevant line agencies’ processes in the long run.

2.    **_Report on the status of NAP implementation_**: Compose a report presenting data on the implementation progress of the six NAP sectors.  This report serves as documentation for the NAP implementation and a basis for crafting the Adaptation Chapter in Task 4

**Task 2 Development of Risk Maps and Sub-Provincial Hazard/Exposure Database**

1. **_Climate-related Risk Database_**: Review existing national datasets on hazards (floods, droughts, heatwaves, storms, landslides, and coastal erosion) and disaster impacts (with attention to gender and social inclusion). Fill gaps with relevant international datasets while ensuring compatibility with national sources.
2. **_Climate Risk Analysis and Exposure Disaggregation_**: Conduct nationwide risk analysis at least at the district level, with further disaggregation to subdistricts where data allows. Break down impacts by urban areas, agriculture, population density, and vulnerable groups. Develop methodologies to assess compound risks from multiple interacting hazards.
3. **_Climate-related Risk Dashboard_**: Develop a web-based, GIS-enabled system with a responsive design to visualize hazard and exposure data. Features will include an interactive map viewer, filters, dashboards, exportable reports, and user management to ensure accessibility and practicality.
4. **_API Integration and Real-time Data Exchange_**: Build tools for managing geospatial datasets, particularly for landslide risk, with user-friendly interfaces, training modules, and an interactive decision-support dashboard.

The Climate-related Risk Mapping System will serve as a national web platform to enhance risk-informed decision-making. It will integrate validated datasets, providing nationwide coverage at the district level and disaggregating to subdistricts where possible, while ensuring usability and accessibility through responsive, GIS-enabled design.

 **Task 3 Baseline Framework and Data Reference Sheet for the Spatial M&E System**

1.     **_Mapping of Existing M&E Systems for Adaptation in Thailand_**: Review government processes and cycles that involve monitoring and evaluation of the government’s projects and performance. Identify the available resources that the climate adaptation M&E system can utilize, and what aspects need development to fulfill the objectives of the climate adaptation M&E system at the national and sectoral levels.

2.    **_Prioritized Spatial Indicators and Data Source Assessment_**: Review progress on the development of adaptation M&E indicators in Thailand. Review case studies, guidance and best practices to identify indicators. The spatial indicators will enhance the understanding of differences in the impact, vulnerability and risk across areas, cities, and regions. The data sources of the spatial indicators will be curated to allow for consistent updating of the indicator values in the long term.

3.    **_Baseline Framework and Baseline Data Reference Sheet_**: Review theory, guidance, and best practices of defining baselines of the indicators within a defined scope. Apply the baseline framework to the selected list of indicators to demonstrate the derivation of the baseline values. The Baseline Data Reference Sheet can be used by the sector to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptation implementation on the changes in the indicator values across time.

**Task 4 Drafting and Finalization of the Adaptation Chapter for 5NC/2BTR**

**_Adaptation Chapter for the 5NC/2BTR_**: The NAP progress report is compiled per the recommended outline by the MPGs (Decision 18/CMA.1). The output will allow Thailand to obtain high-quality and up-to-date adaptation reporting for submission to UNFCCC

  

## 2.2 Proposed Approach and Methodology

Creagy’s methodology is designed to execute the TOR tasks while adhering to UNFCCC guidelines and emphasizing stakeholder participation. We structure our approach around the four major tasks, ensuring that each task’s outputs feed into the next. Across all tasks, our approach aligns with the Enhanced Transparency Framework’s MPGs – we will constantly refer to Section V of the MPGs for adaptation to make sure all required information is covered.

We also adopt a participatory and inclusive process in which key Thai stakeholders will be engaged at every stage for data provision, validation, and feedback. This participatory approach not only enriches the content with local expertise but also builds national ownership, crucial for the sustainability of outcomes.

###  2.2.1 Conceptual Foundation 

This assignment builds on Thailand’s existing climate adaptation architecture and is designed to interoperate with DCCE’s ongoing initiatives. Methods, definitions, indicators, and data flows will align with the National Adaptation Plan and the current coordination structure (shown in Figure 1) so that project outputs complement what exists instead of running in parallel. Interfaces of the outputs with the current DCCE’s climate risk database and platform, adaptation sector processes, and government performance evaluation mechanisms will be set to enable clean connections now and straightforward extensions later.


**Phase 1 - Desk review and framing** 

Task 1 establishes the base for the Adaptation Chapter and the subsequent tasks. It begins with a desk review of UNFCCC transparency guidance (with attention to adaptation reporting elements); Thailand’s NAP (2024 revision), NDC, 4th National Communication (4NC), 3rd Biennial Update Report (3BUR), 1st Biennial Transparency Report (1BTR), and sectoral adaptation plans and documentation. This review synthesizes how adaptation has been framed, implemented, and monitored across the six NAP sectors and identifies gaps or inconsistencies that matter for transparent reporting and the future operational adaptation cycle.

**Phase 2 - Indicator review and alignment** 

The next phase focuses on clarifying relevant indicators and checking for their alignment with benchmarks. Existing NAP and NDC indicators will be organized and compared to internationally evolving guidance—specifically the MPGs and UAE FGCR’s thematic areas and the Adaptation Cycle stages. The intent is to identify which indicators are already used by the Thai administrative system and can be used to represent evidence of adaptation progress, and where practical enhancements (definitions, baselines, spatial disaggregation) would most improve comparability and decision‑relevance for future adaptation cycles.

**Phase 3 -  National Adaptation Cycle proposal** 

Using the information gathered in the previous phases, we will propose a national Adaptation Cycle that situates adaptation planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting within key Thai administrative processes; namely, budgeting, strategic planning, and the annual performance evaluation cycles of government agencies. This mapping clarifies the institutional arrangement and processes with associated datasets. This picture will reveal leverage points to institutionalize adaptation monitoring, evaluation, and reporting. A stakeholder engagement process with DCCE and sector focal points will be used to validate the cycle’s fit with actual practices.

**Phase 4 - Stakeholder mapping and targeted data collection** 

In parallel, we will conduct stakeholder mapping to identify focal agencies and data custodians relevant to adaptation implementation across NAP sectors. Another key stakeholder group comprises the agencies that set the rules for government performance evaluation, which are crucial for activities in Task 3. Through semi‑structured discussions, we will confirm current practices for data collection (at project, agency, and sector levels) and performance evaluation, clarify indicator definitions and data flows, and validate preliminary findings on NAP progress and coherence issues. To support these engagements, we will design concise data collection templates and interview guides aligned with UNFCCC adaptation reporting expectations and, where relevant, the FGCR guidance logic. The interviews will also provide an opportunity to test and refine the templates to ensure their practicality.

**Phase 5 - NAP Progress Report and Adaptation Chapter Outline**

Based on the interview results of adaptation implementation progress, we will develop an annotated outline for the Adaptation Chapter for 5NC/2BTR aligned with the UNFCCC reporting elements. A report of the status of NAP implementation across its priority sectors will be composed to document all details. This report is the groundwork for crafting the Adaptation Chapter for 5NC/2BTR in Task 4.

Throughout Task 1, stakeholder engagement is integral. We will hold periodic working meetings or mini-workshops with DCCE and relevant agencies to present our interim findings and synthesized data for validation. This participatory validation ensures accuracy and builds consensus on the narrative that will appear in the 5NC/2BTR chapter. By the end of Task 1, Creagy will deliver an annotated outline of the Adaptation Chapter (developed in consultation with UNDP/DCCE) covering all required UNFCCC elements, along with a compendium of updated adaptation information (including data tables, stakeholder inputs, and a matrix linking adaptation actions to outcomes) and recommendations for strengthening the adaptation planning/reporting cycle. This establishes a strong knowledge base for subsequent tasks.

**Tools and Methodology**

1. Document analysis

·         Google Scholar and AI research tools such as Elicit for literature gathering

·         Review matrix to extract evidence and compare across references

·         Reference Manager software (e.g. Zotero) for citation management

·         Data crosswalks to identify overlaps and gaps across references.

2. Stakeholder engagement

·         Semi-structured interviews and project milestone consultations.

·         Process mapping synthesis to capture workflows

·         Simple data coding for analyzing interview results

·         Online and physical forms for producing data collection evidence

·         Digital whiteboard tool to aid visual communication during the workshops

·         Interactive polling tools such as Menti meter

#### **Task 2: Development of climate-related risk maps and databases to report various types of hazards and specify risk areas at a sub-provincial level

This task focuses on enhancing Thailand’s climate risk information systems by developing detailed, GIS-based risk maps and an underlying database to identify hazard-prone areas at sub-provincial levels. Our approach for Task 2 is both technical and collaborative.

**Phase 1 - Inception phase**

The Inception Phase will outline the detailed methodology and work plan in close consultation with DCCE and other relevant stakeholders. This phase will also include identifying user requirements through stakeholder engagement and jointly defining the system concept and requirements of the Climate-related Risk Mapping System.

**Phase 2 -** **Data Collection, Database Development and Risk Analytics**

Following the Inception Phase, a consultation meeting/workshop with key stakeholders (e.g., DCCE, DDPM, DMR, etc.) will be convened to discuss data collection and database development. During this phase, existing national datasets on climate-related hazards (floods, droughts, heatwaves, storms, landslides, and coastal erosion) and disaster impacts will be reviewed, with attention to gender and social inclusion where possible. Gaps in data will be supplemented using relevant datasets from international sources, ensuring consistency and compatibility with national datasets.

**Phase 3 -** **Development of Climate-related Risk Dashboard**

The proposed Climate-related Risk Mapping System (Appendix A-0) will serve as a web-based application to strengthen risk-informed decision-making in Thailand. The system will provide a GIS-enabled platform with a responsive design to display hazard and exposure data, incorporating an interactive map viewer, data filters, dashboards, reporting (with export functions), and user management to ensure practicality and user-friendliness. All validated data will be integrated into the platform, with information presented at least at the district level nationwide and further disaggregated to the subdistrict level where data availability permits.

The approach for the **Development of Climate-related Risk Dashboard** is to build an open-source and modular platform. This open-source approach not only reduces costs but also enhances flexibility and integration with existing disaster management systems.

The proposed **Comprehensive Climate-related Risk Dashboard** will be developed using Next.js for the frontend and Python-based frameworks (FastAPI) for backend APIs. The system will integrate multi-source datasets (satellite, multi-hazard, and socioeconomic data) and apply GIS techniques for real-time risk analysis.

Role-based user access, secure API communication, and encrypted storage will ensure data security and controlled access. Development will follow an Agile process with iterative releases, continuous stakeholder feedback, and CI/CD pipelines for efficient delivery. Quality will be assured through unit, integration, and user acceptance testing, with deployment on containerized infrastructure (Docker) for scalability. Post-implementation, the system will include training, documentation, and maintenance support.

The proposed main features of Climate-related Risk Mapping Dashboard Module are:

**Table** **4** Climate-related Risk Mapping Dashboard Module

|**Feature Category**|**Key Capabilities**|
|---|---|
|Multi hazard overlay visualisation|·         Real-time hazard status display<br><br>·         Hazard exposure & vulnerability visualization|
|Interactive map viewer|·         Customized UI/UX for decision-makers<br><br>·         Real-time hazard status display<br><br>·         Interactive Online Map (zoom in/out, Pan to)|

|Dashboard|·         Integration of statistics and descriptive analytics<br><br>·         Customized UI/UX for decision-makers<br><br>·         Present at least at the district level nationwide, and disaggregated to the subdistrict level where data is available|

**Phase 4 –** **Final Release and User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**

The Final Release and UAT will validate the Climate-related Risk Dashboard before deployment. The process will confirm that the platform delivers the intended user benefits, performs reliably under operational conditions, and scales to meet peak demand during emergencies. Testing will focus on system usability, performance, and stability. Stress testing will simulate high usage to confirm the platform’s ability to operate under pressure. User acceptance testing will verify that core functions meet the needs of DCCE, and public users.

The methodology combines system-level validation with structured user testing. The system will first be deployed in a controlled environment that mirrors production. Functional, performance, and scalability tests will be conducted before end-users participate in UAT. This approach ensures that the technology platform works as designed and that users can operate it effectively for landslide monitoring, risk analysis, and emergency coordination.

**Phase 5 –**  **Transfer all the Source Codes, Maintenance and monitoring System Performance and Providing Technical Support**

The transfer process will be carried out in a structured and secure manner to ensure DCCE receives full ownership of the Climate-related Risk system, including source codes, access credentials, and technical documentation. All codebases will be maintained in version-controlled repositories (e.g., GitHub/GitLab), ensuring traceability, transparency, and long-term maintainability. Access credentials and configuration details will be documented and securely shared. A knowledge transfer session will be conducted with the DCCE technical team to walk through the repository, system architecture, deployment processes, and backup/upgrade strategies.

**Operations and Maintenance Services**

The maintenance and support phase will ensure the system remains fully operational and secure up to 14 months after the handover. A proactive approach will be adopted to monitor system performance, address technical issues, and implement necessary enhancements in response to user feedback or evolving requirements. The system will follow a structured maintenance lifecycle, including preventive maintenance, corrective troubleshooting, and adaptive modifications to integrate new features or datasets. Regular updates will be scheduled to patch vulnerabilities, upgrade dependencies, and optimize performance while ensuring minimal downtime.

#### **Task 3: Development of baseline framework and its data reference sheet to support the operations of spatial M&E system of climate change impacts in vulnerable areas**

Task 3 is a three-phase approach, starting with understanding the policy context and framing adaptation M&E. Next, it involves creating the framework's contents to lay out the basic structure. Finally, demonstrate the implementation of the M&E framework through the application of the climate adaptation M&E system’s products and results.


**Phase 1 -  Policy context and M&E need**

In this task, we will propose an adaptation M&E framework for **_national and sectoral levels_**. The framework will consist of key processes and tools. The definitions and objectives of the processes and tools will be established to shape the structure of the adaptation M&E system. Then, we will explore, and curate existing mechanisms and processes embedded in the national budgeting cycle, strategic planning cycle, line ministry and provincial performance evaluation cycles, and NDC tracking. Through desk review and interviews with the stakeholders mapped out under Task 1, we will identify where adaptation M&E can be integrated with existing processes to minimize burden and maximize institutional fit. We will capture stakeholder perspectives on challenges encountered in adaptation M&E—both for internationally funded projects and nationally budgeted initiatives—to ground the framework in practicality. Process mapping will clarify current data collection, aggregation, verification, and reporting pathways in all relevant administrative and governance cycles. The result will highlight assets that the adaptation M&E system can reuse, and reveal the gaps need to be filled to operationalize the adaptation M&E system.


**Phase 2 - Development of the M&E framework**

Using the information gathered in phase 1, Creagy will employ process mapping techniques to visualize how data currently flows from project level to national reports, and where there are gaps or inefficiencies. This will highlight what new processes or institutions need to be introduced for a comprehensive adaptation M&E system.

Based on this analysis, in this task, Creagy will begin the development of the adaptation M&E content with the conceptual **_baseline framework for adaptation M&E_**. The main references of the baseline framework development are document and reports of **_Result-Based Management_** published by climate funds, such as the Green Climate Fund, and development agencies, such as UNDP, GIZ, and World Bank.  This framework will guide the establishment of a baseline for tracking adaptation implementation and its impact. Additionally, we will ensure the framework accounts for gender and social inclusion (e.g., indicators that track outcomes for vulnerable groups) as emphasized in the TOR.

Next, based on the desk review, we will compile a long list of spatially explicit indicators spanning risks, impacts, vulnerabilities (exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity), and adaptation actions relevant to **_sector-level monitoring and evaluation_**. The indicators will be tagged to categorize them based on **_types_**, such as monitoring indicators, evaluation indicators, output indicators, outcome indicators, and impact indicators**.** From this long list, we will create prioritization criteria (e.g. **SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound**) to shortlist the indicators, based on data availability and sectoral relevance. We will use the criteria to create a prioritized set of indicators with clear definitions, calculation methodologies, and units. From the short list, we will assess potential data sources for indicator baseline value computation. Based on data availability and sectoral relevance, we will select a few indicators from the short list to apply the baseline framework to calculate the baseline values.

**Phase 3 - Demonstration and refinement**

From the computed baseline values, we will design an M&E product — the Data Reference Sheet —and illustrate its intended application workflow through a case example. We then combine all outputs in this task up to this point to create a prototype of the indicator toolbox, which will consist of

·         Long list of M&E indicators with tags

·         Prioritization criteria

·         Methodologies for computing prioritized indicators, and

·         Potential data sources for indicator computation

·         A design guideline for the Data Reference Sheet

·         A demonstration of the Baseline Data Reference Sheet

We will then organize a communication workshop with relevant agencies to present the framework and a prototype product and gather expert feedback. The feedback will be incorporated into the refinement of the Data Reference Sheet. The finalized prototype of the indicator toolbox will feed the 5NC/2BTR Adaptation Chapter’s sections on progress in monitoring and evaluation of NAP implementation. More importantly, the result of this task will serve as a foundation for future adaptation cycles.

**Tools and Methodology**

1. Document analysis

·         Google scholar, AI research tools such as Elicit for literature gathering

·         Review matrix to extract evidence and compare across references

·         Reference Manager software (e.g. Zotero) for citation management

·         Data crosswalks to identify overlaps and gaps across references

·         Multi-criteria analysis with clear sets of criteria will be used to prioritize the indicators

2. Quantitative data analysis

·         MS Excel for tool building and simple data processing

·         QGIS software will be used to visualize spatial data and perform simple data processing.

·         Python for heavy-duty data processing and reproducible workflow.

3. Stakeholder engagement

·         Semi-structured interviews

·         Process mapping synthesis to capture workflows

·         Simple data coding for analyzing interview results

·         Digital whiteboard tool to aid visual communication during the workshops

·         Interactive polling tools such as Menti meter

  

#### **Task 4: A chapter containing all information related to climate change impacts and adaptation is written in the 5NC/2BTR (up to 2024) according to the following sections**

This combines the evidence in adaptation progress collected from Task 1 with the work under Task 2 and Task 3 into a complete Adaptation Chapter for the 5NC/2BTR. Drafting will follow the annotated outline developed under Task 1 and will fully address the UNFCCC adaptation reporting elements. Each section will cite its evidence source and maintain consistency with the BTR’s other chapters and other national reports.

Our approach to Task 4 ensures that the chapter is comprehensive, coherent, and undergoes thorough quality control and stakeholder validation before final submission. We will begin by developing the first full draft of the Adaptation Chapter, structured according to UNFCCC reporting guidelines and the annotated outline finalized in Task 1. The chapter will cover all key sections specified in the MPGs and TOR, which include:

(a) national circumstances, institutional arrangements, and legal frameworks relevant to adaptation,

(b) current and projected impacts, risks, and vulnerabilities (with attention to gender and social inclusion),  

(c) adaptation priorities, goals, and challenges/barriers,

(d) adaptation strategies, policies, plans, and actions (and how adaptation is integrated into broader national development policies),

(e) progress on implementation of adaptation actions (what has been achieved under the NAP and other initiatives up to 2024),

(f) monitoring and evaluation arrangements for adaptation (how Thailand tracks effectiveness of adaptation),

(g) information on losses and damages associated with climate change (as available, e.g. economic losses from extreme events, efforts to address loss and damage), and

(h) cooperation, good practices, case studies, and lessons learned in adaptation (including examples of community-based adaptation, ecosystem-based approaches, and successful partnerships).

Creagy will ensure that each of these elements is clearly addressed in the chapter, in line with Decision 18/CMA.1 guidance for adaptation communication/reporting. Our writing team – which includes climate policy experts and technical writers – will use the wealth of information compiled in Tasks 1–3 to craft a concise and rich narrative.

·         Task 1’s results (NAP progress and adaptation stock take) will form the backbone of sections on impacts, vulnerabilities, and implemented measures.

·         Task 2’s results (risk maps) will provide quantitative evidence and possibly visuals (maps or charts) to illustrate geographic vulnerabilities and how adaptation efforts target those hotspots.

·         Task 3’s outcomes (baseline indicators) will allow us to present measurable baselines and reference points for adaptation outcomes, lending credibility to the reporting of progress. By grounding the chapter in data (with appropriate references and figures), we ensure it is evidence-based

We will also maintain a clear line of sight to Thailand’s NDC and NAP commitments, showing how the actions and outcomes reported in this chapter contribute to Thailand’s stated adaptation goals and the GGA. The chapter will be cross-checked to avoid any discrepancies with information in other parts of the 5NC/2BTR (e.g., mitigation section or support received) and with previous reports.

After producing the initial draft, we will initiate a **two-step review and validation process**.

1.     **First, the draft Adaptation Chapter will be circulated to key government stakeholders for written feedback**. This will include DCCE and other relevant agencies or experts identified in Task 1’s stakeholder mapping. Creagy will prepare a feedback form or matrix to solicit structured comments on each section of the chapter. As comments come in, we will systematically address them, clarifying information or incorporating additional data where needed.

2.    **Second,** **Creagy will facilitate a national stakeholder consultation workshop to present and discuss the draft Adaptation Chapter**. This workshop (organized in partnership with UNDP and DCCE) will gather a broad group: government ministries, academia, NGO representatives, and possibly development partners. In the workshop, we will present the chapter’s key findings – such as the state of climate risks and adaptation in Thailand, successes and gaps in NAP implementation, and proposed ways forward. Participants will be invited to provide oral feedback and discuss the content to ensure it is balanced, accurate, and clear. Special attention will be given to sensitive or cross-cutting issues (e.g., how well gender considerations are reflected, or whether the chapter fairly represents all sectors). The feedback from this national consultation will be documented.

Following the workshop, our team will finalize the Adaptation Chapter by integrating all relevant comments and performing a thorough editorial review. We will ensure the final text is clear, logically organized, and meets UNDP’s quality standards. Before submission, we will double-check that all required components (per MPGs) are included and that data is referenced correctly. The final output of Task 4 will be the validated Adaptation Chapter, ready for inclusion in the 5NC/2BTR and submission to the UNFCCC.

In summary, this chapter will stand as a credible, well-supported account of Thailand’s adaptation journey up to 2024, and provide a baseline for future reporting cycles. Creagy’s goal is that the chapter not only fulfills reporting requirements but also serves as a useful document for national stakeholders – summarizing where Thailand stands on adaptation and informing future policy decisions.

Throughout all 4 tasks, Creagy’s approach is underpinned by our technical expertise and commitment to capacity building. Our team has proven experience in climate data analysis, climate risk assessment, adaptation policy, and developing digital tools/platforms. We will leverage this experience to deliver innovative yet practical solutions (such as the user-friendly risk map platform and the M&E framework aligned with the best global practices). Moreover, we are committed to inclusive and sustainable outcomes – by involving Thai stakeholders extensively, we ensure that the knowledge and systems we develop can be maintained and used by Thailand well beyond the project. This approach aligns with UNDP’s emphasis on national ownership and long-term capacity for transparency in climate reporting.
