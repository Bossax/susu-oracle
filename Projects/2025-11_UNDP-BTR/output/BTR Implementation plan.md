## Overview and Approach

This plan turns the TOR into an executable roadmap for Thailand’s **Adaptation Chapter** in the 5NC/2BTR. It aligns activities with the updated weekly schedule and preserves the project’s framing: (1) build a continuous adaptation implementation–M&E–reporting cycle; (2) leverage a sub‑national climate‑risk platform; and (3) institutionalise a baseline M&E framework with a Data Reference Sheet. The timeline below follows the **updated Gantt** while the activities are written in **actionable terms** (not TOR phrasing).

**Guiding principles**

- **ETF‑ready:** conform to UNFCCC MPGs; make evidence traceable and reproducible.
- **Use what exists:** integrate with current datasets, agency processes and roles.
- **Spatial first:** favour district/subdistrict‑level views for decisions and equity.
- **Lean governance:** clarify ownership, QA/QC and data‑exchange early.
- **Inclusive:** incorporate gender and vulnerable‑group lenses in indicators and use cases.

## Key Concepts and Strategic Framing

- **Adaptation implementation and reporting cycle.** Task 1 calls for an inception meeting, an annotated outline of the Adaptation Chapter and the design of a continuous national adaptation cycle. This cycle links planning, implementation, monitoring and reporting within existing national processes and aligns indicators with global adaptation goals.
    
- **Spatial climate hazard information platform.** Task 2 emphasizes developing a structured database of hazard and exposure data, supplementing gaps with international datasets and producing district‑ and subdistrict‑level risk maps. Subsequent sub‑tasks cover ~~risk analysis~~ ~~and~~ exposure disaggregation, interactive map design and integration of validated data into a GIS‑enabled platform, system architecture and security specifications, secure API‑based data exchange and handover with training and dissemination.
    
- **Baseline M&E framework and data‑reference sheet.** Task 3 requires inventorying existing M&E systems and indicators, identifying spatially explicit indicators, calculating baseline values and producing a prototype Data Reference Sheet. A stakeholder workshop then validates the framework before finalization.
    
- **Adaptation Chapter drafting.** Task 4 involves synthesizing evidence from Tasks 1–3 into a coherent narrative covering institutional arrangements, climate risks and vulnerabilities, adaptation strategies, progress, M&E and lessons learned. The draft is validated through written feedback and a national workshop before final submission.

# Engagement & Workshop Schedule

**Objective**
The engagement strategy is designed to ensure structured stakeholder consultation, capacity building, and formal validation at critical quality gates throughout the project lifecycle. This schedule aligns with the specific requirements of the Terms of Reference (TOR) and ensures that all logistical obligations—specifically regarding participant numbers and cost responsibilities—are met.

### 1. Inception and Governance (WP-1) -[x] 

The project commences with the **Inception Meeting** (Task 1.1.a), scheduled for November–December 2025. This session gathers the DCCE, UNDP, and key adaptation sector focal points to confirm project understanding, refine the methodology, and finalize the detailed work plan. The primary output is the approved Inception Report, which serves as the foundational governance document for the program.

### 2. Platform Design and Technical Validation (WP-3) -[ ] 

To support the development of the risk platform, the **Database Consultation Meeting** (Task 2.1.e) is planned to take place on **11 February 2026**. The objective is to discuss data collection methods and validate the database structure with key stakeholders such as DCCE, DDPM, and TMD. 

- approximately 30 participants.

- The contractor leads the organization, while **UNDP covers the logistic costs**. The expected output is a meeting report confirming the dataset list and schema design6.

### 3. Baseline Framework Validation (WP-4)

Once the draft M&E system is developed, the **Stakeholder Consultation Workshop** (Task 3.4.b) is scheduled for **May 2026**. This critical event focuses on validating the draft Baseline Framework Document and the Data Reference Sheet. It involves a larger group of up to 100 participants to ensure broad sector buy-in. **Note:** Unlike other events, the TOR explicitly states that the **Contractor is responsible for covering the logistic costs** for this workshop, using DCCE’s venue.

[[2025-11-13]]
### 4. Platform Launch and Capacity Building (WP-3)

Two distinct events are required to operationalize the risk platform, both targeting a completion date of May–June 2026.

- First, the **Dissemination Meeting** (Task 2.6.b) will be held for approximately 30 participants from relevant agencies to demonstrate the platform’s functionalities and promote its integration into their work.
    
- Second, a comprehensive **Administrator Training** (Task 2.6.b) will be conducted for approximately 20 DCCE staff members to cover platform use, troubleshooting, and sustainability planning.
    

For both of these events, the Contractor organizes the sessions, and **UNDP covers the logistic costs**12.

### 5. Final Chapter Validation (WP-5)

The engagement cycle concludes with the **National Stakeholder Consultation Workshop** (Task 4.2.b) in August 2026. This major event presents the draft Adaptation Chapter for the 5NC/2BTR to discuss key findings and gather comprehensive feedback for refinement13. The workshop is expected to host up to 100 participants14. While the Contractor leads the organization, **UNDP is responsible for the logistic costs**15. The final output is a validated Adaptation Chapter ready for submission16.

# Dependencies & Controls

- **Data alignment:** WP‑4 indicator fields mirror WP‑3 schema (prevent re‑work).
    
- **Change control:** annotated outline and adaptation cycle act as the baseline for scope creep.
    
- **Quality gates:** (1) Baseline Assessment sign‑off (mid‑Mar), (2) M&E Toolkit sign‑off (late‑May), (3) Platform handover (Jun), (4) Draft chapter (early‑Jul).
    

#  Risk Focus (actionable mitigations)

- **M&E Platform Utility Gap:** The platform is being designed for NAP Actions (TDRI), which ==may not== strictly align with A-BTR Outcome reporting [[Analysis of NAP Indicators and Adaptation M&E Contribution (TDRI version)]]. 
	- **Mitigation:** Develop a "Translation Matrix" early to map available NAP data to BTR requirements; maintain a "Manual Override" buffer in the Baseline Assessment if platform data is insufficient.



**Overall duration:** Nov 2025 – Sep 2026. **Primary owners:** DCCE (policy & coordination), platform partner (risk platform), Creagy (analysis, M&E, drafting).
