# Project 1: M&E Implementation Pilot

Lead: Advantage Consulting Ltd. (Mrs. Kaew)

Sponsor: DCCE

- **Objective:** Test the feasibility of gathering and aggregating adaptation data at an administrative (provincial) level, grouping indicators by sector and examining cross-sectoral aspects.
    
- **Methodology:**
    - Reviewing the CU Research Team's "Climate Change Adaptation M&E Manual" and GGA decisions. 
    - Developing a methodology to aggregate impacts of adaptation activities within geographical boundaries.
    - Selecting pilot provinces based on spatial climate risk maps (DCCE v2) and institutional/data readiness.

- **Current Challenges & Insights:**
    - **Unclear Boundaries:** Difficult to determine which projects fall within the scope of Climate Change Adaptation (CCA).
    - **Lack of Awareness:** Line agencies are often unaware of the adaptation benefits their projects generate.
    - **Data Issues:** Baseline values for impact/outcome indicators are missing, and current reporting is subjective.
        
- **Key Timeline:**
    - **Feb–Mar 2026:** Site visits.
    - **Apr 2026:** Data analysis.
    - **May 2026:** Final report submission.
        
- Events
	- We recently got a mock up M&E platform page from CU research team with 3 data dictionary examples (data tables) and the mock-up of the dashboards and interfaces of the platform which helps us understand what data they will collect.
# Project 2: Adaptation M&E Data Platform

**Lead:** Chulalongkorn University (CU) Research Team (Dr. Pavisorn / Dr. King)

- **Objective:** Design an adaptation M&E data system and user interface ("e-form") for gathering reporting data.
- **Methodology:**
    - **Update (Jan 2026):** The platform design is now pivoting to align with **TDRI's NAP Action Plan outputs**. 
    - This implies the "e-form" and database tables will be structured around action-oriented indicators derived from NAP stakeholder engagement, rather than strictly following the theoretical M&E Manual (Exposure/Sensitivity/Resilience) initially proposed.
    - Designing an "e-form" for sectoral focal points to input adaptation indicators.
        
- **Data Strategy:** The system will rely on batch dataset uploads (Excel) or direct API connections where applicable.

- **Current Status:**
    - **Strategic Shift:** The team is incorporating the "Analysis of NAP Indicators and Adaptation M&E Contribution" (TDRI version) into the system design.
    - There is a potential risk that the resulting data structure may be too "activity-focused" (monitoring) and lack the "outcome/impact" logic required for BTR reporting.
        
- **Key Timeline:**
    - **Mar 2026:** Completion of the "e-form" user interface design.
