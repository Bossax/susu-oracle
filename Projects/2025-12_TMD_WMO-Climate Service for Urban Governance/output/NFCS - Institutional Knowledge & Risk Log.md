Purpose: To capture, codify, and manage unwritten institutional realities (political, operational, and behavioral) that impact project delivery.

# 1. Institutional & Political 

_Focus: Budgeting, Mandates, and Strategic Positioning_

| **Insight (Tacit Knowledge)**          | **Context & Implication**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Strategic Action**                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Service vs. Infrastructure Dilemma** | The Ministry of Digital Economy classifies "Climate Services" as a soft service rather than "Digital Infrastructure." Consequently, TMD struggles to request implementation budgets for projects that are not deemed service related such as pioneering new products. | **Re-framing Strategy:** The Costed Action Plan (WP3) must frame climate services as "Technical Infrastructure" or "Capacity Development" to align with eligible budget codes.                    |
| **Strategic Vacuum**                   | TMD currently lacks a proactive climate change strategy. The agenda is often reactive rather than setting the national direction.                                                                                                                                     | **De Facto Strategy:** The NFCS Roadmap we produce will likely serve as the _de facto_ internal strategy. We must ensure it is robust enough to stand alone without a parent strategy to lean on. |
| **Division vs. Department**            | Climate services are currently viewed as the work of the "Climatology Division" rather than a whole-of-department mission. This limits cross-departmental buy-in.                                                                                                     | **Elevation:** The governance structure must explicitly involve higher-level Departmental executives to shift ownership from "Division-level" to "Department-level."                              |

>- [ ] Compare TMD with GISTDA. GISTDA is also an organization that aims to provide information services just like TMD. However, GISTDA manages to acquire a lot of budget to implement proactive information service projects. 
# 2. Operational

_Focus: Internal Capacity and Workflow_

| **Insight (Tacit Knowledge)**                                                              | **Context & Implication**                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Strategic Action**                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task Force Fatigue**                                                                     | TMD typically assigns existing project staff to Task Forces, leading to overburdened members and low engagement.                                                                                                      | **Synergy (Piggybacking):** Do not create a new standalone Task Force. Leverage the upcoming "Urban Act" Task Force to reduce administrative burden and ensure continuity . |
| **Project-Based Reliance**                                                                 | TMD relies on external projects (like Urban Act, WMO) to drive innovation, but integration into core operations is often weak.                                                                                        | **Sustainability Focus:** The roadmap must focus on how to transition project outputs into routine operations (SOPs) rather than just "project deliverables."               |
| **Limited human resources of the Climatology Department**                                  | The current team size is 10 people. The team is understaffed. All team members have to be involved in every process in the project cycle including technical staff involved in site visit and stakeholder engagement. |                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Submitting digital version of deliverables to the sponsor prior to sumission deadlines** | For reports that are complex, send out digital files to the project sponsor                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                             |

# 3. Stakeholder Engagement & Communication

_Focus: User Behavior and "The Gap"_

| **Insight (Tacit Knowledge)** | **Context & Implication**                                                                                                                                      | **Strategic Action**                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The "Tokenism" Risk**       | Agencies often send "the available person" rather than "the right person" to workshops. Non-technical attendees cannot contribute meaningfully to co-creation. | **Strict Profiling:** Develop an "Engagement Playbook" that defines specific technical requirements for nominees (e.g., "Must be a hydrologist" or "Must manage urban drainage data"). |
| **The Science-Policy Gap**    | Stakeholders frequently question the usefulness of TMD products because they cannot interpret the scientific data, even if the data is accurate.               | **Translation Layer:** The project must deliver "Translation Guides" or "Use Case Scenarios" (Science-to-Policy) as part of the User Interface Platform (UIP) design.                  |
| **Unclear Demand**            | It is unclear who should initiate requirements—TMD (provider) or the City (user). This leads to a standstill where neither side defines the specs.             | **Proactive Mock-ups:** We must provide "Strawman" prototypes (mock-ups) in workshops to provoke reactions, rather than asking users to design from a blank sheet.                     |

# 4. Strategic Risk Registry

_Focus: Mapping Tacit Insights to Project Risks_

|**ID**|**Risk Description**|**Probability**|**Impact**|**Mitigation Strategy**|**Owner**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**R-01**|**Funding Ineligibility:** The final Costed Action Plan is rejected by the Budget Bureau because "Climate Services" are not classified as "Digital Infrastructure."|High|Critical|**Mitigation:** Conduct a "Budget Code Analysis" in WP3. Frame all actions under "Technical Capacity Building" or "Data Systems Upgrade" rather than "Service Delivery."|WP3 Lead|
|**R-02**|**Workshop "Tokenism":** Workshop #1 yields generic or useless feedback because participants lack the technical background to define climate service needs.|High|High|**Mitigation:** (1) Send nomination letters with strict technical profiles. (2) Request CVs or current position descriptions of nominees prior to confirmation.|WP2 Lead|
|**R-03**|**Task Force Redundancy:** Creating a new "NFCS Task Force" results in low attendance because the same staff are already committed to the "Urban Act Task Force." 4|Med|Med|**Mitigation:** Formally propose merging the steering function with the Urban Act Task Force during the Inception Phase.|PM / Team Lead|
|**R-04**|**Relevance Gap:** Urban planners reject TMD data as "not useful" because it is delivered as raw scientific variables rather than decision-ready indices.|High|High|**Mitigation:** Use the "Consultation Workshop" to present _translated_ examples (e.g., "Flood Risk Days" vs. "Precipitation mm") to validate utility.|Technical Expert|
