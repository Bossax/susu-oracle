## 2. Project Team

The project is led by the Creagy Expert Team, comprising specialists in climate policy, finance, and law:

- **Boonrod Yaowapruek:** Partner & Team Lead
- **Teeradetch Tungsubutra (Ph.D.):** Energy Sector & Climate Finance Expert
- **Jiraporn Thamniamin (M.Eng.):** GHG Accounting & Climate Advisory
- **Kittinut Supsoontornkul (Doctor of Juridical Science):** Environmental Law & Governance Specialist
    

## 3. Context and Rationale

### The Global & National Imperative

- **Global Goal:** Align with the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise well below 2°C (pursuing 1.5°C) and enhance adaptation capacity.
- **National Goal:** Thailand is committed to a Net-Zero and Climate Resilient Economy by 2050/2065.
- **Urgency:** Thailand is highly vulnerable to both acute physical risks (severe floods, cyclones) and chronic risks (droughts, sea-level rise, heat).
    

### The Core Concept: Climate Services

The framework seeks to transform "Climate Raw Data" into "Actionable Support."

- **Definition:** Climate Services involve the production, translation, transfer, and use of climate information for climate-smart decision-making.
- **Goal:** Ensure widespread generation and use of climate information to enhance societal resilience.
## 4. Objectives

The primary objective is to develop a targeted NFCS for the Urban and Security sectors. Key goals include:
1. **Institutional Alignment:** Connect the Thai Meteorological Department (TMD) with the urban climate policy landscape.
2. **Governance:** Clarify governance arrangements between TMD and user agencies.
3. **Strategic Roadmap:** Develop a costed action plan to integrate services into urban decision-making.
4. **Stakeholder Engagement:** Map capacities and identify needs through consultation.
    

## 5. Methodology (5-Step Approach)

The implementation follows a structured five-step approach:
1. **Assess Baseline:** Identify key stakeholders (DDPM, DPT, DCCE) and evaluate gaps in current service delivery.
2. **Consultation:** Conduct national workshops to foster consensus and gather requirements
3. **Gap Analysis:** Perform a detailed strategic analysis comparing current capabilities against sector needs.
4. **Action Plan:** Develop the NFCS Strategic Plan and Roadmap.
5. **Endorsement:** Finalize and launch the framework.
## 6. Implementation Timeline & Deliverables

The project is structured around key milestones ending in mid-2026:

- **Phase 1: Inception (Deadline: Dec 31, 2025)**
    - Deliverable: Detailed Workplan for targeted NFCS development.
        
- **Phase 2: Analysis & Engagement (Deadline: Mar 31, 2026)**
    - Deliverable: Baseline Assessment Report (Urban Climate Services). (Feb 2026)
    - Deliverable: Sectoral Consultation Workshop (March 2026)
- **Phase 3: Strategy & Conclusion (Deadline: Jun 30, 2026)**
    - Deliverable: Strategic Roadmap & Costed Action Plan.
    - Deliverable: Final Report on Governance Implications.
        

## 7. Role of the Thai Meteorological Department (TMD)

The framework is built upon five pillars defining TMD's role:

1. **Observations & Monitoring:** Establishing stations in vulnerable areas.
2. **Research & Prediction:** Improving model accuracy for extreme weather.
3. **Climate Services Information System:** Managing data to generate decision-support products.
4. **User Interface Platform:** Creating a structured interaction mechanism between TMD and sectors (Health, Water, Urban).
5. **Capacity Development:** Strengthening infrastructure and human resources.
    

## 8. Strategic Action Areas

To bridge identified gaps, the plan focuses on three strategic areas:

- **Data & Information Systems:** Developing accurate disaster warnings and connected databases for situation reporting.
- **Urban Planning:** Integrating climate resilience into building codes and promoting green multi-use spaces.
- **Capacity Building:** Mainstreaming climate risk into education and developing resilience indicators.
