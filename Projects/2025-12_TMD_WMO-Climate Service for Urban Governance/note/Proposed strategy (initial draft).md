## 1) Theory of change

If
1. TMD’s climate services and partner datasets are organized into a clear, service-catalogue with fit-for-purpose products for local decisions; and 
2. mandates, workflows, and data-sharing between TMD, line agencies, PAOs, and municipalities are clarified and supported by capacity building; and 
3. incentives in local planning and budgeting reward projects that demonstrate climate risk reduction and equitable benefits; 
then 
	local development plans will incorporate climate risk screening and measurable outcomes, improving resilience of investments in transport, water, land-use, and public services. 
	
This directly supports the NFCS aim to improve decisions by addressing climate risks, and the assignment’s emphasis on governance arrangements and stakeholder engagement.

## 2) Strategy

1. Start with **==governance==** and **==data use-cases==**, not data. Map who decides what, when, and with which constraints across PAO and municipal planning and budgeting cycles, and where national line agencies act independently in the same geography.

=> connected with DCCE_CRDB
 - [ ] Make a case for using climate data to set a new standard of local governance. Identify priority areas within the urban context to integrate climate information in to decision making

1. Build a minimal, high-leverage service catalogue for those decisions, combining TMD products with hydrology, flood, drought and storm information already used locally, and package them as standard decision supports
=> connected with DCCE_CRDB.
- [ ] Include decision support packages as part of the DCCE_CRDB project. Treat the Data product catalog as a broad database of data product, create *use case* database, which might be similar to adaptation result database, and design the decision support packages (which can be considered as information products)

3. Institutionalize through NFCS Steps 0–3: a co-designed workplan, a participatory baseline, a sectoral consultation and task force, and a validated roadmap with a costed action plan and financing options.

## 3) Workplan mapped to NFCS steps

### Step 0 Preparation and workplan

Co-design the workplan with TMD and partners; review laws and policies (NAP, draft Climate Change Act, TMD strategies, spatial planning policies); and define the urban governance scope and milestones. Note that the tentative timeline reads “01.12.2025–31.06.2026,” which appears to include a non-existent date; this should be corrected during inception.
### Step 1 Baseline and capacity assessment
Use questionnaires, key informant interviews, and focus groups to assess: 
- current data sources and tools
- decision points in planning/budgeting
- staff roles and capacities
- existing use of climate and water data (flood, drought, storm),
- gaps in mandates and data-sharing.

### Step 2 Sectoral consultation

Facilitate a national-subnational consultation focused on the human settlements and security sector to test the service catalogue, discuss institutional arrangements, and surface intergovernmental coordination issues where line agencies own assets within local jurisdictions.

> must include CSO, NGO, local DRM practitioners
### Step 3 Roadmap and action plan

Establish a multi-stakeholder task force with TMD; draft and validate a strategic roadmap and costed action plan, including financing options and recommendations for other NAP sectors. Produce concise progress notes throughout.

## 4) Action items ranked by implementation challenges (easy to hard)


1. Mapping mandates and decision cycles
    This can be done largely through desk review and structured interviews, which are already within the NFCS Step 1 tasks (“map and assess baseline capacities” via participatory methods) and Step 2 consultations. It requires coordination and synthesis rather than policy change, and it directly aligns with the assignment’s responsibility to “assess and facilitate discussions on mandates and clarify governance arrangements.”
    
2. Minimal service catalogue and decision-support briefs  
    Packaging existing, commonly used datasets (e.g., water management, storm, flood, drought) into decision-ready briefs for local planning is achievable early because the sources and current uses already exist in practice (e.g., zoning, drainage maintenance, reservoir operations). A first cut can be co-validated in the sectoral consultation workshop under Step 2.
    
3. Capacity-development and support model (design) — moderate  
    Designing the model (who supports whom, when, and how requests are triaged) is feasible within the assignment because it mainly needs alignment with the “IUS expert(s) and GIZ” on governance and capacity-building outputs. ==The constraint is not the design itself but future resourcing and scheduling to match local plan/budget windows==, especially where PAOs lack in-house professional planning capacity.
    
~~4. Planning and budgeting integration (templates, climate-risk screening, pilot) — harder  
    Drafting templates and a screening rubric is straightforward; getting them used systematically is not. Your note highlights that current budgeting does not reward resource efficiency or rigorous evidence, and data use is siloed in strategy/planning divisions. This institutional inertia means pilots are realistic in the project window, but embedding criteria in routine appraisal processes will require more time and high-level buy-in.
    
1. ~~Data governance and interoperability (MOUs/SOPs across agencies) — hardest~~  
    ~~Formalizing data-sharing protocols across TMD, line agencies, PAOs, and municipalities is the most politically and administratively complex. Central line agencies still operate and invest in assets within local jurisdictions (e.g., highways) without needing PAO/municipal approval, which limits local leverage and complicates reciprocal obligations around data, notifications, and timing. The assignment’s scope is to assess and facilitate discussions on mandates; securing binding inter-agency agreements typically exceeds an eight-month window and may require decisions above project level.~~~~
    

Two context variables cut across all items. First, the mayoral term and five-year plan cycles set real decision windows and should be used to sequence engagement and pilots. Second, the NFCS deliverables (baseline, consultation, roadmap, costed plan) provide built-in moments for validating each step, which is why items 1–3 cluster at the “easier” end and items 4–5 trend harder.

## 5) Output specifications

### 5.1 Inception report and detailed workplan
A concise document confirming scope, timeline, roles, risks/assumptions, and methods for the baseline and consultations, plus a rectified schedule.

### 5.2 Baseline assessment package
A methods annex (tools, questionnaires), a capacity map for TMD and local actors, a data/services inventory, and a decision-point map for planning and budgeting cycles, with a gap analysis.

### 5.3 Consultation concept notes and summaries
Objectives, agenda, stakeholder list, and facilitation plan; post-event summaries capturing decisions, open issues, and next steps, explicitly documenting central–local coordination pain points where national assets sit inside municipal areas.


### 5.4 Strategic roadmap
A governance chapter clarifying institutional arrangements and a RACI; a service catalogue with user guidance; a capacity development plan with a support model; and a monitoring framework with indicators for uptake and decision impact.

### 5.5 Costed action plan
A three-year implementation plan with activities, milestones, roles, unit costs and financing options, plus a first-year procurement and training schedule that aligns with local plan cycles. Recommendations should also flag opportunities to extend into other NAP sectors.
