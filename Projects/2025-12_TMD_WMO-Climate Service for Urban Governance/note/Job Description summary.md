# Task - Support development of National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS) for Thailand focusing on human settlement and security (urban) sector with Thai Meteorological Department (TMD)

Under Output 1 of the project “Improved institutional environment for climate-sensitive urban development”, one such improvement is to support TMD to develop a NFCS for Thailand. A general introduction to the NFCS process was given by the WMO Secretariat to TMD and the GIZ to build a comprehensive understanding of the importance, the main functions, and the outcomes. Further activities under this component will revolve around the development of a framework for the integration of climate services into ==urban governance==.

While the NFCS approach is cross-sectoral, a targeted approach provides an opportunity to align with the objectives and partnerships of the Urban-Act project and support a specific sector under the **NAP: Human Settlements and Security**. The consultant is asked to support this process in line with the needs and capacity of TMD’s Climate Center staff.

**Required tasks:**
1. Assess the baseline on climate services focusing on human settlement and security (urban) sector in Thailand
2. Engage key stakeholders relevant to the human settlement and security (urban) sector at national and sub-national level, including the Urban-Act project partners
3. Develop the strategic plan and costed action plans for the integration of climate services into urban governance and decision-making processes in Thailand


## Targeted NFCS for human settlement and security sector

- **Objective:** establish a systematic sustainable structure for the regular delivery of climate services in cities through:
    
- Assessing the climate services needs for urban planning **at the national level** (NFCS Step 1 – baseline assessment, complement existing reports)
    
- Engaging key stakeholders **relevant to the human settlement and security sector at national level** (NFCS Step II – consultation)
    
- Designing mechanisms for climate services integration into urban governance and decision-making process (NFCS Step III – development of strategic plan)
