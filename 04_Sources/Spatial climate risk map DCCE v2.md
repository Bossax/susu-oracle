#RU-CORE
# Main Update
- Non-climatic indicator list is expanded through stakeholder consultations.
- They separately represent sensitivity (increase vulnerability) and adaptive capacity (decrease vulnerability), and exposure. 

# Use case
- Prioritize resource allocation to regions.
- not applicable to financial portfolio risk analysis
	- risk indicators in the risk map cannot be applied to financial sector
	- what is useful is hazard maps


# Sectoral Important Risk
- One can select a specific set of exposure or vulnerability indicators which represent a group of interest for risk calculation.

# Limitation
- Non-climatic indicators **severely** lack the historical baselines
- There are no exposure and vulnerability scenarios developed in this project
- Province level risk data must be accompanied by more granular data from other line agencies.  
-  The information is not meant for detailed planning. For action plans, detailed studies in the specific area are required in addition.
