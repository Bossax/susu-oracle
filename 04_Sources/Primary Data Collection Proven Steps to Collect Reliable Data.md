>**Primary data is firsthand, context-rich information collected directly from people, programs, or environments.** Unlike secondary data—which is repurposed or historical—primary data captures the real-time voice and evidence you need for confident, measurable decisions.

==Analysts spend 80% of their time cleaning and reconciling errors before they even begin analysis.==
## 10 Non-Negotiables for Primary Data Collection
1. Clean-at-Source Validation
	Block bad data before it enters. Required fields, format checks, and duplicate prevention keep metrics trustworthy. Result: reporting prep time drops 30–50%.
2. Identity-First Collection
	Every response links to a unique participant ID. Track journeys across pre→mid→post without losing records. Eliminates the typical 15–20% ID loss during linkage.
3. Mixed-Method Pipelines
	Combine surveys, interviews, observations, and documents in one place. Keep numbers connected to the "why" with same ID and timestamp across all sources.
4.  AI-Ready Structuring
	Turn long text and PDFs into consistent themes, rubric scores, and quotable evidence automatically. Converts weeks of manual coding into minutes of processing.
5. Field Notes & Observations
	Staff capture real-time notes tagged to participant profiles. Pair observations with attendance and scores. Required metadata: date, site, observer role.
6. Continuous Feedback Loops
	Replace annual surveys with touchpoint feedback after every session. Dashboards refresh automatically. Mid-term adjustments can lift completion rates 8–12%.
7. Document Analysis
	Extract insights from PDFs and case studies against rubrics. Link evidence back to participant IDs with deep-links to source snippets for full transparency.
8. Numbers + Narratives Together
	Read scores next to confidence levels and barriers. When a metric drops, the narrative explains why. Context prevents misinterpretation of trend data.
9. BI-Ready Exports
	Export clean tables to Power BI or Looker with data dictionaries and references back to original text. Field provenance included in every export.
10. Living, Audit-Ready Reports
	Reports update as new data arrives. Preserve "who said what, when" for continuous learning. Structured inputs plus reviewer sign-off maintain traceability.
