# Typology of economic actors adaptation
## 1. Macroeconomic adaptation
### Actor
1. Private sectors
2. Government 
3. International organizations
4. Central banks
### Characteristics 
- Macroeconomic adaptation involves adaptation planning, financing, regulation, and direct investment at national and supra-national levels. It focuses on systemic interventions that shape the enabling environment for adaptation across an entire economy

### Policy focus
1. incentive
2. information tools
## 2. Microeconomic adaptation
### Actors
- household
- individual firm

### Characteristics
- Microeconomic adaptation encompasses autonomous actions taken by individual households, smallholder farmers, and firms in response to perceived climate risks. These actions are shaped by localized information, preferences, and direct experience with climate impacts.

- The actions are driven by self-interest and local risk perceptions, but often constrained by limited access to resources, market information, and public goods
### Policy focus
1. Systemic resilience
2. public goods

## 3. Interaction
Macroeconomic adaptation sets the context, incentives, and infrastructure that enables (or constrains) effective microeconomic adaptation.


## Edge case
if a state-owned enterprise behaves as a commercial firm and undertakes a firm-level risk-management investment, you could classify that particular investment as micro. But for standard line ministries and departments, the correct classification is macroeconomic adaptation creating the context, incentives, and public goods that enable micro responses.
