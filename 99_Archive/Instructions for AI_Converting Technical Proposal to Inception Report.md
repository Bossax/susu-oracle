# Summary Principle

**The fundamental shift is from "Choose us because..." to "Here's exactly how we'll work together."**

The inception report assumes the contract is won and focuses entirely on successful implementation. It's a planning and alignment document, not a sales document. Every section should answer operational questions, not prove capability.


# REMOVE Entirely

```
❌ Section 1: Qualifications of Service Provider
❌ Company profile, certifications, business licenses
❌ Detailed CVs (full employment history, publications)
❌ Track record with contract samples
❌ Financial statements
❌ All "proof of capability" appendices
❌ Persuasive language about company strengths
```

# TRANSFORM

#### **1. Executive Summary**

- **From**: Brief overview emphasizing capability
- **To**: Detailed summary with:
    - Confirmed understanding of assignment
    - Brief project background
    - Clear deliverable structure with specific dates
    - Duration (e.g., "26 months")
    - Key milestones

#### **2. Objectives Section**

- **From**: "Our understanding of requirements"
- **To**: "Objective" - written as confirmed shared goals
    - Remove "we understand that..."
    - State objectives directly as project goals
    - Add any clarifications from inception meeting

#### **3. Methodology**

- **From**: Conceptual approach emphasizing capability
- **To**: Operational methodology showing:
    - MORE specific steps and processes
    - Integration points with client's existing systems
    - Tools and techniques to be used (named specifically)
    - Data sources identified
    - Coordination mechanisms
    - Add "Conceptual Foundation" section showing alignment with client's ongoing initiatives

#### **4. Work Plan**

- **From**: General timeline with phases
- **To**: Detailed implementation schedule with:
    - Specific calendar dates (not just "Month 1")
    - Granular task breakdown
    - Dependencies clearly shown
    - Deliverable submission dates
    - Review/validation periods
    - Workshop/meeting dates

#### **5. Team Structure**

- **From**: Full CVs proving qualifications
- **To**: Brief team structure diagram
    - Names and roles only
    - Reporting lines
    - Key responsibilities
    

# ADD New Sections

```
✅ "Conceptual Foundation" 
   - How outputs align with client's existing systems
   - Integration points with ongoing initiatives
   - Compatibility with client's processes
   
✅ "Deliverables" section
   - Structured table with:
     * Deliverable number and name
     * Expected date
     * Key components
     * Review/approval process
     
✅ "Quality Assurance and Risk Mitigation"
   - Specific QA measures
   - Risk identification
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Version control approach
   - Review protocols
```

# TONE & LANGUAGE SHIFTS

| From (Technical Proposal)           | To (Inception Report)           |
|:----------------------------------- |:------------------------------- |
| "Creagy's approach demonstrates..." | "The approach involves..."      |
| "We will deliver..."                | "The project will deliver..."   |
| "Our team has proven experience..." | [Remove - focus on methods]     |
| "This showcases our capability..."  | [Remove]                        |
| Persuasive, competitive             | Collaborative, confirmatory     |
| Future tense                        | Present tense where appropriate |
| "We propose..."                     | "The project adopts..."         |

# FORMATTING ADJUSTMENTS

- Remove all company branding appendices
- Simplify header to show project name and date
- Focus on content readability over marketing appeal
- Add clear section numbering for easy reference
- Include table of contents
- Add list of abbreviations/acronyms

# Validation Checklist

An inception report should pass these tests:

**For the Client/Funder:**
- Can I confirm we're aligned on what will be delivered?
- Do I understand HOW the work will be done?
- Can I track progress against this plan?
- Are there any surprises I should address now?
- Do I have confidence in the level of detail and preparation?

**Content Tests:**
- No marketing language or capability claims
- Specific dates, not just durations
- Operational detail, not conceptual promises
- Evidence of integration with our systems/processes
- Clear deliverables with acceptance criteria
- Risk mitigation strategies included
