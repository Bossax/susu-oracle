**Performance Measurement Framework (PMF)** is an essential component of the Green Climate Fund's (GCF) **Results Management Framework (RMF)**. It is designed to measure the results of the Fund's investments and can serve as a basis for results-based payments.

# Purpose and Alignment
    
- The PMF is aligned with the **mitigation and adaptation logic models** of the GCF, translating inputs and activities into strategic results.
- Its overall purpose is to enable effective monitoring and evaluation of the **Fund's outputs, outcomes, impacts**, and its organizational effectiveness.
- It aims to include **measurable, transparent, effective, and efficient indicators and systems** to support GCF operations, including co-benefits and gender sensitivity.
- The high-level format of the PMF table is intentionally simple, with specific technical definitions, baselines, data sources, calculation methodologies, reporting formats, and targets to be added later.

# Indicators
- The PMF includes a **flexible menu of core, impact, and outcome indicators** corresponding to the Fund’s result areas.
- There are **43 indicators** in total that inform the RMF, which include paradigm shift objectives, core, impact, and outcome indicators, both approved and noted by the Board.

**Types of Indicators**
*Fund-level indicators*
- **Core Indicators**: These are Fund-level impact indicators that apply to all GCF projects and programs based on their type.
	- For **mitigation**, core indicators include: **tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2eq) reduced**, **cost per tCO2eq decreased**, and **volume of finance leveraged** by Fund funding.
	- For **adaptation**, the core impact indicator is the **total number of direct and indirect beneficiaries**, and the number of beneficiaries relative to the total population.
	- Cross-cutting projects are required to inform both mitigation and adaptation core indicators.
- **Paradigm-Shift Objective Indicators**: These are intended to measure the "Degree to which the Fund is achieving low-emission, sustainable-development impacts" (for mitigation) or "Increased climate-resilient sustainable development" (for adaptation). However, the sources note these are often vague and require further refinement.

*Project-level  indicators*
- **Impact and Outcome Indicators**: The PMF lists numerous specific impact and outcome indicators for both mitigation (e.g., "Tonnes of CO2eq reduced or avoided as a result of Fund-funded projects/programmes - gender-sensitive energy access power generation") and adaptation (e.g., "Number of males and females benefiting from introduced health measures to respond to climate-sensitive diseases").

- **REDD+ Indicators**: The PMF also includes specific indicators for REDD+ results-based payments, primarily focused on tonnes of CO2eq reduced or increased removals.

>The PMF **does not prescribe output indicators**; these are chosen and designed by the Fund's stakeholders, allowing for flexibility and specificity in projects.

- Gender disaggregation is to be applied to indicators where possible.

# Reporting Requirements and Responsibilities
    
- **Accredited Entities (AEs)** and implementing entities (IEs) have the primary responsibility for **annual reporting** on performance based on these indicators.
- APRs (Annual Performance Reports) submitted by AEs must include **updates on indicators**, aligning with the modalities set out in the GCF's RMF and its PMFs.
- The GCF Secretariat is responsible for implementing the Monitoring and Accountability Framework (MAF), which guides the overall monitoring and reporting process.



# Challenges and Areas for Improvement
- **Lack of Guidance**: A significant concern is the **critical absence of definition, guidance, and protocols** for how PMF indicators are defined, measured, by whom, and with what frequency and how they should be aggregated. This has led to inconsistent guidance and methodologies across projects and entities.

- **Consistency Issues**: The different logic models for adaptation, mitigation, and REDD+ can lead to **inconsistencies in causality and measurement**, making aggregation and comparison difficult. For instance, core adaptation indicators lack clear protocols on identifying and counting beneficiaries, leading to varied approaches.

- **Marginalization in Practice**: The PMF has been somewhat **marginalized in its use by the Secretariat and project stakeholders**, with other Board-approved frameworks like the Investment Framework (IF) and Monitoring and Accountability Framework (MAF) often receiving more attention.

- **Planning Deficiencies**: A large proportion of GCF projects have **not sufficiently planned for credible reporting** of results and impacts, with many proposals lacking baseline data collection plans or having insufficiently articulated M&E plans.

- **Gender Integration Gaps**: While there's a commitment to gender sensitivity, the gender policy and toolkit are not fully integrated into the PMF beyond the design of gender-sensitive reporting, affecting comprehensive monitoring and evaluation.

- **Need for Harmonization**: There is a need to **harmonize concepts and indicators with other key agencies and stakeholders**, including linking with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators, to reduce reporting burden and enhance consistency

- **Data Aggregation**: There is currently **no system within the GCF Secretariat to consolidate and aggregate reported information** across entities effectively, which can lead to double counting of results and challenges in demonstrating overall Fund impact.

The GCF is recognized as a continuously learning institution, and the PMF results, indicators, and associated methodologies are expected to be refined and adapted based on best practices and lessons learned.
