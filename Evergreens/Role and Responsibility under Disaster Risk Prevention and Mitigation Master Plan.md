# Local Administrative Organizations (LAOs)/Local Government Units (LGUs)

- **Developing and Implementing Local Disaster Management Plans:** **All provinces and local administrative bodies are mandated to develop their own disaster management plans** for their specific jurisdictions. These plans, including **DRM Action Plans updated annually at the local level**, should align with the National Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Plan and guide risk management activities within their areas.
    
- **Local Responsibility for Disaster Risk Management:** **Local administrative units have full responsibility over disaster risk management within their jurisdiction** as outlined in Section 20 of the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Act. This encompasses the entire disaster management cycle.
    
- **Budget Allocation for DRM:** LGUs are **obliged to set aside their own budget** (generated from local revenues) for disaster risk management activities according to their respective DRM plans. While facing financial constraints, they can seek additional support from central or provincial government agencies or reallocate existing budgets.
    
- **First Responders in Emergencies:** **All local governments assume the roles of first responders** when emergencies occur within their jurisdictions. If a situation exceeds their capacity, authority over operations can be transferred to higher administrative levels.
    
- **Connecting National Priorities to Local Action:** Local governments play a crucial role in **connecting national development priorities to locally-led action and resilience building**. Their understanding of the local context is vital for effective implementation.
    
- **Capacity Building and Strategic Coherence:** Continued efforts are necessary to **build the capacities of the LGUs** to effectively manage disaster risks. Ensuring strategic coherence and harmonized planning among those responsible for local-level risk governance is also important.
    
- **Strengthening Local Emergency Response:** Local authorities need to further strengthen and expand their **local incidence response plans and standard operating procedures (SOP)**, focusing on multi-hazard management.
    
- **Implementing Risk Prevention and Mitigation Measures:** LGUs are involved in implementing practical measures for risk prevention and mitigation at the local level, such as land-use planning and setting safety standards in residential areas.
    
- **Participatory Investment in DRM:** LGUs are encouraged to promote **participatory investment in disaster risk management** involving the government, private sector, and civil society at the local level.
    
- **Community-Based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM):** LGUs are essential in implementing **Community Based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM)** approaches, working with communities to build their capacity to understand, prepare for, and respond to disasters.
