This is an analysis of the latest work by TDRI on national adaptation action plan and indicators
## Overview of the National Adaptation Plan (NAP)

The National Adaptation Plan (NAP) prepared by Thailand’s research institute divides adaptation measures into six sectors: water resources, agriculture and food security, tourism, health, natural resources (coastal and marine) and human settlement/community security. Section 2.2 of the NAP lists these six sectors. Each sector includes a high‑level objective, a set of indicators and a portfolio of strategies and activities.


## Sector‑by‑Sector Summary

### Water resources management

- **Main indicators** – The NAP defines two high‑level indicators for the water sector: (1) a **Water Security Index (WSI)** and (2) the **value of damage to life and property from water‑related disasters**. The WSI is a composite index, measured through four dimensions—water for domestic consumption, water for agriculture, flood/drought protection and water conservation/ecosystem health. The second indicator measures the economic value of damage to life and property from floods, droughts and storms, which reflects the severity of water‑related disasters.
    
- **Sub‑indicators** – The revised database breaks the WSI into four sub‑indicators corresponding to its dimensions. The damage indicator is split into damage to human life and damage to property.
    
- **Strategies and activity classes** – Four broad strategies (catchment management, flood/drought management, water conservation & ecosystem health and early warning/support mechanisms) correspond to the water sector’s goals. Activities include watershed rehabilitation, reservoir construction, nature‑based solutions, data and forecasting systems and early‑warning services. These activities fall into multiple activity classes: **hard infrastructure** (e.g., reservoirs, levees), **soft infrastructure** (ecosystem restoration), **knowledge management** (data and early warning), **financial mechanisms** and **policy/regulation**.
    
- **Gaps** – Key gaps include a lack of integrated data on water supply and demand, ageing infrastructure and fragmented institutional responsibilities.
    

### Agriculture and food security

- **Main indicators** – Section 2.3.3 of the NAP states that the agriculture sector has two indicators. The first indicator measures the **proportion of quantity and value of agricultural production losses due to climate factors compared with total production and agricultural GDP**. The second indicator concerns the **reduction in government compensation for losses and the food self‑sufficiency ratio (SSR)**.
    
- **Sub‑indicators** – Indicator 1 splits into two metrics: percentage of production lost and percentage of value lost. Indicator 2 splits into the monetary value of compensation and the SSR (ratio of domestic production to consumption).
    
- **Strategies** – The NAP assigns explicit strategies to each indicator:
    
    - **Management of crop farmland** – adjust planting calendars, irrigation and soil management.
        
    - **Management of livestock farmland** – improve shelters and grazing management.
        
    - **Management of fisheries and aquaculture** – diversify species and improve water quality.
        
    - **Supporting mechanisms** – provide research, technology and financial support. These strategies map directly onto the two indicators, making agriculture the only sector with a one‑to‑one linkage between indicators and strategies.
        
- **Activity classes** – Activities span hard infrastructure (irrigation schemes), soft infrastructure (climate‑resilient farming techniques), knowledge management (research and extension services) and financial mechanisms (insurance).
    
- **Gaps** – Data on climate‑related production losses are sparse. Farmers’ access to climate‑resilient technologies and coordination among agricultural and climate agencies are limited.
    

### Tourism

- **Main indicators** – The tourism section identifies two indicators: (1) a measure of the **adaptive capacity level of the tourism sector to climate change** (ระดับความสามารถในการปรับทางการท่องเที่ยว) and (2) the **value of damage to the tourism industry from climate‑related disasters**. The adaptive‑capacity indicator is assessed through several sub‑indicators, including the share of destinations open year‑round, the number of destinations receiving adaptation awards, destinations with climate‑resilient infrastructure, coverage of early warning systems and the number of new tourism activities. The damage indicator measures economic losses due to reduced tourist numbers and business losses receiving government support.
    
- **Strategies** – The plan proposes three strategies: (1) **management of natural tourist sites**, (2) **management of human‑made tourist sites** and (3) **tourism support mechanisms** such as data, early warning and capacity building. Unlike the agriculture section, strategies are not linked explicitly to individual indicators but provide an overall framework.
    
- **Activity classes** – Activities involve upgrading infrastructure (e.g., flood‑proofing cultural sites), nature‑based shoreline protection, developing risk maps and warning systems, diversifying tourism products and supporting community adaptation. These correspond to activity classes such as hard infrastructure, soft infrastructure, knowledge management and financial/insurance mechanisms.
    
- **Gaps** – The sector lacks comprehensive early warning systems tailored to tourism, resilient infrastructure for tourist sites and capacity among communities and operators to diversify livelihoods.
    

### Human settlement and community security

- **Main indicators** – Chapter 6 of the NAP defines three indicators for the human settlement and security sector. These are (1) the **percentage of comprehensive urban plans integrating climate change adaptation in high‑risk areas**, (2) the **ratio of public spaces designed to cope with hazards such as floods, drought or heat in urban areas** and (3) the **value of economic and social damage from climate‑related natural disasters**. The third indicator captures economic and social losses rather than the number of cities with early‑warning systems, which is not listed in the manual database.
    
- **Strategies** – Each of the first two indicators is paired with a specific strategy in the manual database: the urban‑planning indicator links to **enhancing the capacity of cities and communities to integrate adaptation into land‑use plans**, and the public‑space indicator and the damage indicator both link to **promoting the design of open spaces and green spaces to serve as hazard mitigation structures**. Unlike agriculture, these strategies apply to multiple indicators, so the linkage is partial.
    
- **Activity classes** – Activities include updating land‑use plans, risk zoning, training planners, creating multifunctional green spaces, designing cooling corridors and integrating stormwater management features. These correspond to knowledge management, soft and hard infrastructure and regulation.
    
- **Gaps** – Few urban plans integrate climate risk assessments; public spaces seldom incorporate flood and heat resilience; and damage data on economic and social losses are often incomplete. Early‑warning systems are still limited, though they are not formal indicators in the manual database.
    

### Natural resources (coastal & marine)

- **Main indicators** – In the NAP’s natural resource management section the manual database lists two indicators. The first indicator measures the **quantity and quality of habitats** (ปริมาณและคุณภาพแหล่งที่อยู่อาศัย), capturing the extent and condition of terrestrial, wetland, freshwater, marine and coastal ecosystems. The second indicator is a **threatened species status index** (ดัชนีสถานภาพชนิดพันธุ์ที่ถูกคุกคาม), which monitors the status of species at risk of extinction.
    
- **Sub‑indicators** – For the habitat indicator, sub‑indicators include the quantity and quality of **terrestrial habitats**, **wetland and freshwater habitats** and **marine and coastal habitats**, reflecting the three ecosystem domains identified in the plan. The threatened‑species index can be broken down into the **number of threatened species by category** and **population trends of threatened species**.
    
- **Strategies** – The sector’s strategies cover **terrestrial ecosystem management**, **wetland and freshwater ecosystem management**, **marine and coastal ecosystem management** and **support mechanisms for natural resource management and biodiversity**. These strategies focus on conserving and restoring ecosystems, managing resources sustainably and providing institutional and financial support. The plan does not explicitly assign strategies to each indicator, so they serve as a sector‑wide framework.
    
- **Activity classes** – Activities include mangrove reforestation, coral reef restoration, living shorelines (soft infrastructure), fisheries regulations and community‑based conservation (knowledge management and regulation).
    
- **Gaps** – There is incomplete data on ecosystem health and coastal degradation. Enforcement of conservation rules is weak and communities often lack resources to lead restoration.
    

### Health sector

- **Main indicators** – Unlike other sectors, the health chapter of the NAP does not provide a long list of climate‑sensitive disease metrics. Instead it specifies two high‑level indicators, consistent with the original “Indicator” sheet supplied by the user. The first indicator is that the **public health system must be capable of managing climate change risks so that climate‑related illness and death rates decline**. The second indicator measures the **economic damage from health impacts due to climate change**. These indicators are adaptive capacity and impact metrics respectively, and they align with the targets outlined in the NAP’s health section. They replace the earlier speculative indicators (incidence rate, health‑facility counts, etc.).
    
- **Sub‑indicators** – Because the NAP does not break these two indicators into sub‑indicators, the revised database proposes reasonable metrics to operationalise them. For the first indicator, sub‑indicators include the **rate of climate‑related illnesses**, the **rate of climate‑related deaths** and a **health‑system readiness index**. For the second indicator, the sub‑indicator is the **economic cost associated with climate‑related health impacts**. These sub‑indicators provide measurable proxies while staying faithful to the NAP’s intent.
    
- **Strategies** – The health sector retains two strategies from the original “Indicator” sheet: **prevention of climate change impacts on health** and **public health support mechanisms**. These strategies encompass measures such as disease surveillance, early warning for heat and vector‑borne diseases, upgrading health facilities and developing financing and support systems. In the updated dataset the health indicators are explicitly linked to these two strategies to mirror the agriculture sector’s linkage.
    
- **Activity classes** – Activities include developing heat‑health action plans, vector control programmes, retrofitting hospitals, training health workers, enhancing disease surveillance systems and financing mechanisms. These correspond to the activity classes in the database (soft and hard infrastructure, knowledge management and financial mechanisms).
    
- **Gaps** – The health sector faces gaps in data linking climate and health outcomes, limited resilient infrastructure, insufficient early warning and surveillance systems and a need for greater capacity among health workers and communities.
    

## Contributions to the adaptation M&E system

1. **Types of indicators** – The NAP indicators mostly measure **outcomes** and **impacts**. Outcome‑level indicators (e.g., self‑sufficiency ratio, confidence in tourism safety, proportion of resilient public spaces) capture immediate adaptation results. Impact indicators (e.g., WSI, damage values, disease incidence) reflect the longer‑term state of resilience or vulnerability. Some indicators (e.g., number of health facilities with resilient infrastructure) fall into the **output** category.
    
2. **Suitability for sectoral evaluation vs monitoring** 
	1. Many of the NAP indicators are **aggregated measures** suited for national or sectoral monitoring. 
	2. The Water Security Index and damage indicators provide high‑level statistics that help monitor trends but may obscure local heterogeneity. 
	3. Indicators like the percentage of city plans integrating adaptation and the number of cities with early‑warning systems are more suitable for **evaluation at the sectoral or local level**, as they track policy uptake and capacity development. 
	4. Tourism sub‑indicators and agriculture’s SSR are useful for **monitoring** but should be complemented with qualitative assessments.
    
3. **Aggregation and assessment** – Indicators such as the WSI or damage values are designed for **aggregation** across regions and time. They require standardised methodologies and national data systems. In contrast, indicators based on qualitative or place‑specific information (e.g., percentage confidence in tourism safety, integration of adaptation into urban plans) may resist aggregation and instead need **top‑down assessment** through surveys, audits or expert judgment. The tourism “confidence” indicator, for example, depends on perceptions and therefore needs careful survey design. The agricultural loss indicator can be aggregated but demands consistent data on production losses and damages.
    
4. **Overall contribution** – The NAP’s indicator framework contributes to the national adaptation M&E system by establishing outcome/impact metrics, identifying sub‑indicators and outlining strategies. ==Agriculture stands out as the only sector where strategies are explicitly assigned to indicators==. In other sectors, strategies serve as cross‑cutting frameworks rather than being indicator‑specific. The plan introduces diverse activity classes—ranging from infrastructure development to knowledge management and policy instruments—which align with good practice in adaptation M&E. However, many indicators lack baseline and target values, making it difficult to track progress. Furthermore, the absence of explicit strategy–indicator linkages in most sectors may hinder accountability. Integrating more local‑level and qualitative indicators (e.g., community resilience, ecosystem services) and establishing clear baselines would enhance the M&E system’s effectiveness.
