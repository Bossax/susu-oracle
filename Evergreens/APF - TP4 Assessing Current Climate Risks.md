# #Hazards_based_approach 

> Risk = Probability of climate hazard x Vulnerability (exposure is integrated with vulnerability)

Has a sense of probabilistic or quantitative approach of [[Comprehensive Risk Management]]

# #Vulnerability_based_approach 

Focus on reducing vulnerability. If vulnerability criteria exceed the acceptable ranges, there are risks

Fixing  vulnerability (+exposure in the modern IPCC's framework) will allow us to measure the magnitude and frequency of climate hazards (through loss and damage?)

# #Adaptive_capacity_approach 

Focus on improving the systems to cope with climate change and variability

# #climate_risk_baseline

*Coping range* is the range of a climatic variable in which no damage (economic or non-economic) incurred

To measure vulnerability, critical thresholds ( #Limits_to_adaptation in the modern framework) must be defined (by  indicators/ variables)

**Critical thresholds** are defined as any degree of change that links the onset of a critical biophysical or socio-economic impact to a particular climatic state. It marks a transition into vulnerability
