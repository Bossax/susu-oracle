Monitoring and Evaluation and Retrofitting Lessons Learned Monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of adaptation-related measures is an essential step. It is indispensable for correcting past mistakes, improving current practices and building knowledge through learning-by-doing. The engagement of relevant stakeholders is critical at this stage, including in the selection of indicators, so as to ensure a broad consensus on any assessments (OECD 2009).

Monitoring will need to be specifically focused on assessing whether the identified adaptation options were actually put in place and on any unexpected problems that arose in the implementation process. In addition, monitoring should address whether the adaptation options had any **adverse or positive impacts on other sectors or regions**, and whether the costs of adaptation exceeded budgeted amounts (OECD 2009).
