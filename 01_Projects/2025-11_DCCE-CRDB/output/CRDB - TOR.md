# **Terms of Reference (TOR)**

Project: Hiring a Consultant to Develop a Knowledge Dataset on Climate Change Risks and Impacts for Thailand

Agency: Department of Climate Change and Environment (DCCE)

---

## **1. Rationale and Background**

Climate change is a significant global challenge that broadly affects Thailand in every dimension—economic, social, and environmental—directly impacting the security and livelihoods of the people. The Department of Climate Change and Environment, as the core agency for driving the country's climate change operations, has established the **Climate Change and Environment Center (CCE Center)**. The objective is to develop climate change databases and integrate climate data with relevant agencies.

Previously, this data center has not yet developed a **National Climate Adaptation Information Framework**. Therefore, the Department recognizes the importance of developing this framework to present necessary adaptation datasets. This aligns with the content under the (Draft) National Climate Change Act, B.E. ..., which specifies that, at a minimum, there must be climate data, assessments of risks and impacts from climate and climate change, guidelines and examples of adaptation to climate change, and results of climate change adaptation implementation.

Furthermore, the lack of systematic collection of datasets and knowledge regarding climate change risks and impacts limits the synthesis and use of such data to develop products that meet user needs. The Department of Climate Change and Environment intends to synthesize and develop data products that are accessible and responsive to the needs of users from various relevant agencies. This will enable network partners and the public to use this knowledge to drive adaptation operations concretely and efficiently, leading to the sustainable achievement of the National Adaptation Plan's goals.

## **2. Objectives**

2.1 To study and analyze disaster reporting systems, and develop forms for reporting loss and damage; and to assess the status of climate data, information products, and baseline datasets related to risks, impacts, and adaptation in Thailand.

2.2 To analyze the demand for climate data, risks, and adaptation among various agencies; conduct a Gap Analysis; and develop the National Climate Adaptation Information Framework, including an Information Product & Baseline Data Inventory.

2.3 To formulate policy and technical proposals, develop long-term data management, and disseminate knowledge sets on climate change risks and impacts via both online and offline channels.
