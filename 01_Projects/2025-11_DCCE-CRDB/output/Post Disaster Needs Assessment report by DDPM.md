# กรอบการประเมินความต้องการหลังการเกิดภัยพิบัติ (PDNA)
1. การประเมินความเสียหายและความต้องการความช่วยเหลือ ระยะที่ 0-2 (Damage andNeeds Assessment : DaNA)
2.  การประเมินความต้องการหลังเกิดภัยพิบัติ ระยะที่ 3 (Post-Disaster NeedsAssessment : PDNA)
3. การจัดทำยุทธศาสตร์การฟื้นฟู ระยะที่ 4 (the recovery strategy)

## Key recommendations

1. **Guidelines for Developing Damage Assessment and Needs Analysis Tools**
    - The **assessment forms** designed by the research team for different phases (0-4) should be **piloted in real local areas** to refine the assessment model and key data sets for suitability and ease of use across all levels of disaster management.
    - The **database system needs to be updated** to better support the assessment process.
    - **Information systems should be designed and developed into Web Applications or Mobile Applications** for convenient and rapid field data collection.
    - **Personnel development is crucial to standardize humanitarian assistance operations**. This involves relevant agencies working with the DaNA Working Group (DaNA-WG) to develop standards for personnel in nine "humanitarian cluster approach" areas (e.g., health, water, sanitation, nutrition, food security, shelter management, emergency communications, logistics, protection, education). This also includes annual "giving" humanitarian assistance training domestically and biennial "receiving" training from international partners.
    - **Cooperation in developing Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) forms** (specifically for phases 3-4, such as in the agriculture sector) is needed. Experts and responsible agencies, like the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives for the agricultural sector, should lead this development, with the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (DDPM) playing a joint role, especially for Human Recovery Needs Assessment (HRNA).
    - **Information Management (IM) systems should be developed for data sharing** within, between, and across agencies, and with the public. This includes providing offline collaboration areas, ICT support in the field, and internet connectivity to manage data rapidly and efficiently, thereby strengthening coordination networks that include affected individuals and media.
    - **Clear roles, responsibilities, and coordination mechanisms** should be established among data providers, assessment agencies, and users to ensure integrated and practical assessments.
    - A key principle for developing assessment forms is to **maximize the use of existing databases** from data-providing agencies and employ analytical/assessment methods that accurately determine damage and aid needs for disaster victims.

2. **Structure of the Assessment Team**
    - The research team proposes establishing a **"Damage and Needs Assessment Working Group (DaNA-WG)"** as a policy-level body responsible for **planning, system development, and management**.
    - Under the DaNA-WG, there would be **operational "Damage and Needs Assessment Teams (DaNA Team)"** divided into three levels:
        - **National DaNA Team (N-DAT)**: Responsible for data collection, analysis, and assessment for national-level disasters (Level 3: major, Level 4: extremely severe).
        - **Provincial DaNA Team (P-DAT)**: Responsible for data collection, analysis, and assessment for provincial-level disasters (Level 2: medium).
        - **District/Local DaNA Team (D/L-DAT)**: Responsible for data collection, analysis, and assessment for local-level disasters (Level 1: minor).
    - The **DDPM will have a significant role** in DaNA operations, especially in Phases 1-2, and a vital joint role with other agencies in Phases 3-4.
3. **Development of a Volunteer System for Data Collection and Survey**
    
    - **A volunteer system should be developed for data collection and surveys**, leveraging existing volunteers from various government agencies (e.g., agricultural volunteers, public health volunteers, social development volunteers, Red Cross volunteers, civil defense volunteers) and students from educational institutions.
    - A **"List of trainees' system" should be established and continuously updated** to ensure continuity and sustainability of the volunteer network.
4. **Driving Disaster Knowledge to the Public through Standardized Curricula**
    
    - **Developing standardized curricula for local-level assessment training or for training local volunteers** in data collection and preliminary damage/needs analysis techniques is recommended. This approach would widely disseminate knowledge and allow for training a large number of volunteers without requiring them to travel to central locations.


## Data collection through the phases of DRM

Here are the phases of disaster risk management and their associated data collection forms as described in the report:

1. **Phase 0: Preparedness**
    
    - **Description:** This phase focuses on **planning and preparation** before a disaster strikes. It involves collecting baseline data on various aspects of a community to understand potential risks and capacities. Key activities include preparing assessment methods, indicators, equipment, and training personnel.
    - **Associated Data Collection Form:** The **"Preparedness Assessment Form" (แบบฟอร์มเตรียมความพร้อม ระยะที่ 0)** is used for this phase. This form helps assess the readiness of a unit and its assessment team. It collects **baseline data** across eight sub-categories:
        1. **Population data:** Number of people by gender and age, households, floating population, disabled individuals, bedridden patients, chronic patients, and pregnant women.
        2. **Location data:** Number and location of households, government offices, educational institutions, public health services, facilities for vulnerable groups, religious sites, important historical sites, open/public areas for temporary shelters, and hazardous zones (e.g., chemical, fuel, toxic waste, dangerous animal farms).
        3. **Infrastructure data:** Number and location of electricity systems (power plants, substations), water supply systems (water treatment plants), land transportation systems (roads, bus stations, train stations, railways, bridges), water transportation systems (ports, waterways), air transportation systems (airports), and telecommunication systems (signal towers, broadcast towers).
        4. **Economic data:** Number and location of agricultural areas, livestock farms, fisheries, industrial factories, and commercial establishments (shops, companies, department stores, gas stations).
        5. **Meteorological data:** Weather forecasts and cumulative rainfall reports (24 hours, 7 days).
        6. **Hydrological data:** Water level reports, tidal surge reports, drainage reports, location of waterways (rivers, canals), and water storage facilities (dams, reservoirs, weirs, monkey cheeks), and irrigation stations.
        7. **Topographical data:** Maps of local administrative boundaries, topographic maps, land use maps, and building use maps.
        8. **Historical disaster data (past 3-5 years):** Reports on disaster timing, scale, type, severity, affected areas, damage to life and property, impact, risk areas, and prevention/remediation efforts.
    - The form also includes sections to assess **readiness for disaster response** (e.g., risk area surveys, registered personnel/experts/volunteers, machinery/vehicle inventory, budget readiness, communication systems, incident action plans, evacuation plans, EOC setup, DaNA team readiness, knowledge dissemination, community-based DRR).
2. **Phases 1-2: Damage and Needs Assessment (DaNA)**
    
    - **Description:** This is an **initial rapid assessment** conducted immediately after a disaster (Phase 1: 0-72 hours; Phase 2: within 14 days) to quickly gather information on the situation, impacts, and urgent humanitarian needs. It employs the **Multi-Cluster/Sector Initial Rapid Assessment (MIRA)** methodology.
    - **Associated Data Collection Form (Phase 1):** The **"Initial Disaster Assessment Form" (แบบประเมินภัยพิบัติขั้นต้น ระยะที่ 1)**. This form collects basic information for rapid reporting:
        - Location of assessment and DaNA team members.
        - Disaster information: type and nature of disaster (e.g., flash flood, standing water, overflowing river, storm, landslide), duration, specific location, and the current disaster management level (minor, medium, major, extremely severe).
        - Population data: affected population, evacuees, deceased, injured, missing, and vulnerable groups (elderly, unsupervised children, disabled, chronic/bedridden/psychiatric patients, homeless).
        - Public utilities: functionality status of roads, electricity, water supply, landlines, mobile phones, radio, and internet.
        - Affected housing: number of partially/totally damaged or uninhabitable houses.
        - Urgent aid needs: ranked according to necessity, including search and rescue equipment, consumables (food, water, clothing, medicine, hygiene kits), public infrastructure (temporary bridges, roads), and specialized personnel.
    - **Associated Data Collection Form (Phase 2):** The **"Multi-Cluster/Sector Initial and Rapid Assessment (MIRA)" form (แบบประเมินความเสียหายและความต้องการ ระยะที่ 2)**. This form builds upon Phase 1 with more detailed data collection, often involving primary data collection at the community level (Community Level Assessment - CLA). It covers:
        - Location of assessment, DaNA team details, and disaster information (similar to Phase 1 but more granular).
        - Detailed population data: affected residents and floating population by gender, age, and impact severity, as well as vulnerable groups and primary occupations.
        - Affected areas: damages to residential properties, commercial buildings, factories, hotels, markets, livelihood assets (vehicles, fishing boats, livestock, crops, ponds), and public utilities (roads, bridges, dams, religious sites, educational institutions, hospitals).
        - **Non-Food Items (NFIs) needs** according to Sphere standards: drinking water, cooking equipment, feminine hygiene products, toiletries, bedding, clothing, first aid, water purifiers, pet management, and waste management.
        - Water and sanitation: accessible water sources and needed latrine types.
        - Health: operational health services, available medical personnel (doctors, nurses, volunteers), and prevalent health problems.
        - Food: primary food sources and food security during the disaster.
        - Shelter: evacuation characteristics, reasons for evacuation, number of shelters, and details of shelter management (sleeping facilities, latrines, showers, kitchen, common areas, medical points, registration, donation points, vulnerable group care, parking, religious areas, disability access, waste management, security).
        - Education: affected educational institutions, operational status, and impacts on students/staff.
        - Protection: number of vulnerable children (orphans, separated children) and potential threats (human trafficking, child labor, violence, drugs, sexual abuse, missing children).
        - Information: sources of information before, during, and after the disaster, and barriers to accessing information.
        - Overall summary of urgent needs and assistance received from various agencies.
3. **Phases 3-4: Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA)**
    
    - **Description:** This detailed assessment is conducted **after the emergency response has concluded** to plan for long-term recovery and reconstruction, following the "Build Back Better and Safer" principle. It assesses **damages, losses, and recovery needs**.
    - **Associated Data Collection Form:** The report presents a draft **"Post Disaster Needs Assessment: PDNA (ภาคเกษตรกรรม)" (แบบประเมินความต้องการหลังเกิดภัยพิบัติ ระยะที่ 3–4 (ภาคเกษตรกรรม))** focusing on the agricultural sector (crops, livestock, fisheries) as a case study. This form has four key steps:
        1. **Creating pre-disaster baseline data:** This step involves gathering detailed historical data to establish a reference point. This includes:
            - **Agricultural household data:** Number of farmers and households, household size, agricultural landholdings, household income (from agriculture and non-agriculture), expenses (for agriculture and others), and debt.
            - **Agricultural production data:** Area cultivated/harvested, yield per rai, total yield, farm-gate/market prices, and number of farmers for various crops (rice, rubber, oil palm, durian, mangosteen), livestock (chicken, cattle), and fisheries (farmed shrimp, farmed fish).
            - **Monthly production data:** Quantity of ready-to-market produce for each agricultural type per month.
            - **Water sources for agriculture:** Type, capacity, benefited area, number of benefiting households, and managing authority (private/public, government agencies/local organizations).
            - **Agricultural inputs:** Number and estimated value of cultivated areas, livestock/fish farms, agricultural machinery, farm tools, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, animal feed, and veterinary medicine.
        2. **Assessing damages and losses:** This step quantifies the direct and indirect impacts of the disaster. It involves:
            - **Damage assessment:** Number and cost of damage to crops, livestock (deaths/missing), fisheries (deaths/missing), agricultural inputs (partially/totally damaged), and agricultural water sources (repair/replacement costs).
            - **Loss assessment:** Estimated loss of agricultural production value by comparing pre- and post-disaster production quantities and prices, reflecting changes in farmer income.
            - **Summary of damages and losses:** Aggregation of damage and loss values, including their proportion to the Gross Provincial Product (GPP), Gross Regional Product (GRP), and Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
        3. **Verifying damage and loss data:** This step involves meetings with sectoral assessment teams to summarize and discuss assessment results, identify data issues, and propose solutions.
        4. **Developing the recovery strategy:** This final step outlines the recovery and reconstruction needs based on the damage and loss assessments, prioritizing budget allocation and defining policy measures and programs under the "Build Back Better and Safer" concept.
