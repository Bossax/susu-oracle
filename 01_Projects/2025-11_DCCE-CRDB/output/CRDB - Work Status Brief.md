# 1. Current project health & priority
**Green (On Track)**. The project is fully in the **Architecture & Discovery** phase. The Inception Report was submitted (Jan 7) and approved. Priority is now on **Focus Group #2 (March 10)** and the **Interim Report (March 24)**. We are currently analyzing the "Data Landscape" and drafting the **National Climate Adaptation Information Framework (NCAIF)**.

# 2. Near‑term focus (next 2–4 weeks)
1. **Prepare Focus Group #2 (Mar 10):**
    - Develop "Seed Use Cases" (Flood, Drought, Heat) to test the NCAIF.
    - Draft the initial "Data Landscape" findings for validation.
    - *Goal:* Validate the conceptual model with internal DCCE stakeholders.
2. **ADPC Data Coordination:** Monitor the output of the ADPC Consultation Meeting (Feb 19) to understand what "Official" data will be available.
3. **Draft Interim Report:** Begin synthesizing desk research, landscape analysis, and initial NCAIF concepts for the March 24 deadline.
4. **Draft**:
	1. Business Glossary
	2. System Objective
5. **Refine NCAIF: Content & Logic:** Further refine the NCAIF sitemap content, particularly:
    - Clarifying the value proposition for "Hazardous Events" by focusing on aggregated statistics and analytical insights.
    - Refining the integration of "RESILIENCE_ASSESSMENT" to clearly represent it as a process generating `COMPOSITE_INDEX` outcomes.
    - Formalizing the approach for "Case Study Library" content management, considering internal management vs. future external CMS integration.
    - Refine Adaptation Subject Area [[Conceptual Data Model for climate risk and adaptation data system]]

# 3. Key decisions & assumptions to remember
- **NCAIF as "Enterprise Model":** We are designing the *logical* structure for DCCE's future data system, not just a physical database.
- **Dependency on ADPC:** We rely on ADPC to provide the "Physical Baseline" data. Our role is to catalog and govern it.
- **Spreadsheet Catalog:** The initial deliverable is a spreadsheet-based catalog, not software.
- **IVRA First:** The architecture focuses on the **IVRA (Identification, Vulnerability & Risk Assessment)** workflow first, before expanding to M&E.

# 4. Imminent milestones & deadlines
- **19 Feb 2026:** ADPC Consultation Meeting (Data Acquisition Milestone).
- **10 Mar 2026:** Focus Group #2 (Internal Prototype Validation).
- **24 Mar 2026:** **Interim Report Submission** (Critical Billing Milestone).

# 5. Short‑term risks & watchpoints
- **ADPC Data Availability:** If ADPC delays data sharing after the Feb 19 meeting, our "Baseline Inventory" will be empty.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Ensuring Focus Group #2 (Mar 10) has the right attendees to meaningfully validate the "Use Cases".
- **Complexity Creep:** Keeping the NCAIF simple enough for non-technical stakeholders to understand during the focus group.

# 6. Next sponsor/steering message
- **Progress:** Inception phase complete. We are deep in the "Data Landscape" analysis.
- **Upcoming:** Preparing for Focus Group #2 to test our initial data concepts with DCCE staff.
- **Alignment:** Monitoring ADPC's data collection closely to ensure our catalog structure matches the incoming data.
- **Target:** On track for the Interim Report in late March.
