***Key changes***
- **NCAIF** is now defined as the **Enterprise Data Model (EDM)**.
- Scope shifted to **Conceptual and Logical Models**; Physical schemas are explicitly out of scope (except for Data Products).
- **Data Catalog** implementation defined as a low-code **Spreadsheet** solution.
- Distinct separation of **Business Metadata** (Glossary) and **Technical Metadata** (Data Dictionaries).

This implementation plan translates the Terms of Reference (TOR) and the accompanying technical proposal into a coherent technical roadmap. It emphasizes designing conceptual frameworks, metadata specifications and workflows rather than building software. The goal is to create a shared understanding among the project team, DCCE and stakeholders about how climate‑adaptation data and knowledge should be organized, catalogued and governed. The structure mirrors the key deliverables identified in the TOR, reframed in data‑engineering terminology.

## Strategic Alignment with UNDP-BTR (ADPC)

To ensure efficiency and avoid duplication with the parallel **UNDP-BTR Project (Task 2 implemented by ADPC)**, this project adopts a specific "Curator vs. Manager" distinction:

| Feature     | **ADPC (BTR Project)**                                                            | CRDB                                                                                                               |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Role**    | **The Builder & Curator**                                                         | **The Architect & Librarian**                                                                                      |
| **Scope**   | **Visualizing** 5 Official Historical Hazards (Flood, Drought, Heat, Storm, SLR). | **Managing** the full Adaptation Data Ecosystem (Risk gaps, Future projections, Vulnerability, Strategy, Results). |
| **Output**  | **Physical Risk Platform** (The "Showroom").                                      | **Enterprise Data Model & Governance** (The "Archive System").                                                     |
| **Synergy** | ADPC collects the specific files; CRDB catalogs them.                             | CRDB codifies ADPC's operational rules into long-term DCCE policy.                                                 |
|             |                                                                                   |                                                                                                                    |

## Relationship with adaptation M&E

| **Component**     | **BTR Project (WP-3 & WP-4)**                                                                                                                                                                                               | CRDB Project                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **M&E Framework** | **The Lead Designer (WP-4):** Developing the Data Reference Sheet, Translation Matrix, and prioritizing CU indicators.                                                                                                      | **The Data Supplier:** CRDB focuses solely on architecting the **"Physical Baselines"** (Hazard/Climate Data) that BTR WP-4 requires to calculate its "Climate Baseline" indicators. |
| **Action**        | **CRDB Outcome:** We effectively "outsource" the M&E taxonomy work to BTR WP-4. Our deliverables will reference the BTR M&E Toolkit as the standard for Stage 5 (Results), while we focus our effort on **Stage 2 (IVRA)**. |                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Key Project Deliverables and Strategic Framing

**Strategic Focus: IVRA-First Architecture**

This project adopts an **incremental, use-case-driven approach** to data architecture design. Rather than attempting enterprise-wide transformation, we focus on establishing the **IVRA (Identification, Vulnerability & Risk Assessment) data system** as the foundational layer. This system will serve as the "prime example" of modern data management within DCCE, with future divisions linking their systems to this core.

The deliverables are designed as **System Requirements** for future IT infrastructure procurement, not software implementations. They provide the conceptual and logical blueprints that will enable DCCE to request budget for a modern Data Lakehouse in subsequent fiscal years.
### 1. National Climate Adaptation Information Framework (NCAIF)

**Type:** Business Taxonomy / Knowledge Hierarchy

**Purpose:**
- Enable non-technical stakeholders to navigate climate adaptation concepts
- Provide consistent terminology (Business Glossary)
- Organize data catalog tags

**Scope:**
- **Deep Modeling:** IVRA domains (Meteorology, Hazards, Exposure, Vulnerability, Impacts, Loss & Damage)
- **Shallow Modeling:** Adaptation actions and M&E results (external integration points)

**Artifacts:**
- Hierarchical knowledge structure document
- Business Glossary spreadsheet

**NOT Included:** Entity relationships, cardinality, data flows


### 2. Conceptual Data Model (CDM) for IVRA System

**Type:** Entity-Relationship Model

**Purpose:**
- Define the core entities and relationships for risk assessment data
- Establish business rules governing data integrity
- Serve as foundation for Logical and Physical models

**Scope:**

- **Primary Focus:** Risk assessment workflow entities
    - Climate/Meteorological Events
    - Hazard Events
    - Exposed Assets (Population, Infrastructure, Agriculture)
    - Vulnerability Factors
    - Adaptive Capacity Indicators
    - Impact Assessments
    - Response Actions
    - Loss & Damage Records

**Derivation Method:**
- **Use-Case Driven:** Model entities based on actual risk assessment questions:
    - "Which areas are exposed to flood hazards?"
    - "What is the economic loss from drought in agricultural sector?"
    - "How does adaptive capacity reduce vulnerability?"

**Artifacts:**
- **Conceptual ERD:** High-level entity-relationship diagrams
- **Entity Definitions:** One-paragraph description of each entity's purpose
- **Relationship Specifications:** Cardinality and optionality rules
- **Business Rules Document:** Constraints and validation requirements

### 3. Data and Knowledge Assets

**A. Risk Assessment Data Catalog**

A structured spreadsheet-based catalog registering datasets essential to IVRA workflows:

- **Coverage:** Hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and climate projection datasets
- **Metadata Depth:** Full technical specifications
    - Spatial: Resolution, coordinate system, coverage extent
    - Temporal: Time period, update frequency, temporal resolution
    - Format: File type, schema, access method
    - Quality: Completeness, accuracy assessments, known limitations
    - Provenance: Source agency, collection methodology, version history
- **Taxonomy:** Tagged according to NCAIF risk assessment categories

**B. Information Product Inventory (Business Context)**
Catalog of analytical products with emphasis on risk outputs:

- **Priority Products:**
    - Spatial Climate Risk Map (lineage traced to Bronze/Silver layers)
    - Climate Risk Index (source datasets linked to Baseline Inventory)
    - Sector risk assessments
- **Metadata:** Purpose, business value, analytical methods, version, owner, use cases

**C. External System Assets (Lightweight Cataloging)**
For M&E and adaptation datasets:
- **Business Metadata Only:** Name, owner, description, thematic category
- **Purpose:** Enable discovery and avoid duplication, not full technical documentation
- **Rationale:** Detailed data dictionaries are the responsibility of respective system owners (CU team for M&E)

**Artifacts:**
- **Risk Assessment Data Catalog:** Spreadsheet with ~50-100 essential datasets
- **Information Product Inventory:** ~20-30 products with full lineage for risk outputs
- **External System Registry:** Lightweight catalog of M&E/GHG datasets for cross-reference

### 4. Minimum Viable Dataset for Loss & Damage Reporting

Framed as the **Logical Data Model for the Loss & Damage subject area** within the EDM:

**A. Core Entities**
- **Event:** Disaster type, location, date, intensity, duration
- **Impact:** Affected population, infrastructure damage, economic losses by sector
- **Response:** Emergency actions, evacuation statistics, relief distribution
- **Recovery:** Reconstruction costs, timeline, resilience improvements

**B. Alignment**
- **DDPM PDNA Framework:** Mapped to post-disaster assessment phases
- **Sendai Framework:** Indicators for disaster loss reporting (Targets A-G)
- **International Standards:** DesInventar, UNDRR guidelines

**C. Implementation**

- Validation through pilot data collection from ≥3 historical events
- Integration with DDPM's existing reporting workflows

**Artifacts:**
- **Loss & Damage Logical Data Model:** Entity-relationship diagrams with attribute specifications
- **Pilot Report:** Validation results from historical disaster events


### 5. Data Governance Framework (Risk Database Charter)

**A. Role Definitions (Specific Assignments)**
- **Data Owner:**
    - Who owns the Risk Baseline? (Risk Assessment Division vs. source agencies)
    - Decision authority for data access, retention, quality standards
- **Data Custodian:**
    - IT responsibilities for storage, backup, security
    - Technical maintenance of catalog and metadata
- **Data Steward:**
    - Subject matter experts responsible for validation
    - Quality checks before Silver layer promotion

**B. Service Level Agreements**
- **Update Frequency:** "Hazard maps updated annually; baseline exposure every 2 years"
- **Availability:** "Risk data accessible to M&E system via API with 99% uptime"
- **Response Time:** "Data requests processed within 5 business days"

**C. Data Quality Standards**
- **Completeness:** Minimum coverage requirements (e.g., "85% of provinces")
- **Accuracy:** Validation rules (e.g., "Exposure totals reconcile with NSO census")
- **Timeliness:** Age thresholds (e.g., "Climate projections <5 years old")

**D. Data Lineage Documentation**
- **Bronze → Gold Traceability:** Document transformations for key indicators
- **Provenance Tracking:** Source agency, collection date, processing history

- **Data Quality Rule Book:** Validation checklist for Silver layer promotion
- **Lineage Documentation Template:** Standard format for tracing data flows


### 6. Stakeholder Engagement (Validation & Buy-In)

Engagement activities are strategically sequenced to build incremental consensus:

**A. Internal DCCE Focus Groups (Iterative Validation)**
- **FGD 1 (Late-Jan):** Ecosystem mapping with GHG/M&E/Risk Index project owners
    - Goal: Position NCAIF as integration hub, not competitor
    - Output: Technical constraints checklist, interface requirements
- **FGD 2 (Early-Mar):** Prototype validation with Risk Assessment Division

## Work Package 6 – Evaluation, Recommendations and Closure

**Objective:** Evaluate project outputs, consolidate recommendations for future implementation and ensure knowledge transfer.

### Key activities and timeline

 - **Evaluation (Jun – Aug 2026):** Assess if the Spreadsheet Catalog and Logical Models effectively support DCCE's data discovery needs.
- **Recommendations (Aug 2026):** Roadmap for future _Physical_ implementation (e.g., moving from Spreadsheet to a dedicated Data Catalog software, or implementing the Data Lakehouse)
- **Final documentation (Aug – Sep 2026).** Compile all deliverables into a final project report and executive summary. The final report is due **4 September 2026** but we must submit 2 weeks earlier. 
- **Knowledge transfer (Aug 2026).** Conduct handover sessions with DCCE staff to explain how to maintain and update the inventories and apply the MVD and governance guidelines.
    

**Deliverables:** Project evaluation report, recommendations & roadmap, final project report and executive summary, and knowledge‑transfer materials, due August 2026.

# Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                                       | Potential Impact                                              | Mitigation                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Limited data sharing**                   | Incomplete inventories; delays in cataloguing datasets        | Leverage ADPC data collection process                                                                                                                    |
| **Heterogeneous data quality**             | Difficulties in standardising datasets; unreliable analyses   | Leverage ADPC data collection process                                                                                                                    |
| **Confusion over "Logical" vs "Physical"** | Stakeholders expect a built database but get a diagram/model. | **Early Expectation Management:** Explicitly define "EDM" and "Logical Model" in the Kick-off. Emphasize that physical data stays in source databases.   |
| **Spreadsheet Limitations**                | The catalog becomes too large or complex for a spreadsheet.   | **Strict Scope Control:** Focus the catalog on "Essential Risk Assessment" areas first. Design the spreadsheet with a future database migration in mind. |
| **Complexity of Business Logic**           | NCAIF hierarchy becomes too academic and unusable.            | **User-Centric Validation:** Treat the NCAIF as a "Business Artifact" and validate it with non-technical staff early (WP3).                              |
