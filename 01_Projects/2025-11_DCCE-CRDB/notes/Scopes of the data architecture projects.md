origin_prompt: does an organization usually hire a consultant to create an enterprise data system? what are the typical scopes of work that spread across different projects
relevance_to: "[[]]"
---


Organizations often do bring in consultants for enterprise data systems, especially for strategy, architecture, and initial implementation, but usually with a parallel plan to build internal capability over time. Consultants are most common when the work spans multiple departments, technologies, and change‑management challenges, rather than a single, contained IT project.[mondo+3](https://mondo.com/insights/what-enterprise-consulting-spend-reveals-about-the-future-of-hiring/)​

## Why organizations hire consultants

- To assess the current data landscape and maturity, identify gaps, and design an enterprise data strategy and roadmap aligned with business goals.[kanerika+2](https://kanerika.com/blogs/data-strategy-consulting/)​
    
- To access specialized skills in data architecture, governance, platform selection, and integration that the organization does not yet have in‑house, on a project‑based basis.[dataideology+2](https://www.dataideology.com/data-consultant-vs-full-time-employee/)​
    
- To reduce risk during major implementations or transitions (e.g., new enterprise data platform, cloud migration), where prior experience and patterns matter.[sciencedirect+2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471772725000181)​
    

## A) Strategy and design phase

These usually sit in one or more projects over 2–6 months and may be repeated as the organization matures. Common work packages include:[hso+2](https://www.hso.com/data-analytics/strategy/)​

- Discovery and assessment
    - Inventory of data sources, platforms, reports, and integrations; interviews with stakeholders; mapping current data flows and pain points.[sonata-software+1](https://www.sonata-software.com/platformation-services/data-analytics/data-platform-assessment-and-architecture-consulting)​
    - Data maturity assessment across people, process, technology, and governance, plus benchmarking against peers.[hso+1](https://www.hso.com/data-analytics/strategy/)​
        
- Target state, architecture, and roadmap
    - Design of target enterprise data platform and architecture (data lakehouse, integrations, security, scalability, interoperability).[elitmind+2](https://www.elitmind.com/offering/data-platform-strategy-consulting)​
    - Prioritized roadmap with phases, use cases, milestones, and indicative TCO/ROI to sequence projects over several years.[analytics8+2](https://www.analytics8.com/blog/elements-of-a-data-strategy/)​
        
- Governance and operating model
    - Definition of data governance framework, roles (owners, stewards), policies, and standards for quality, access, and compliance.[eluminoustechnologies+2](https://eluminoustechnologies.com/blog/data-strategy-consulting/)​
    - High‑level operating model for a data office or analytics center of excellence, including skill profiles and org design recommendations.[mondo+1](https://mondo.com/insights/what-enterprise-consulting-spend-reveals-about-the-future-of-hiring/)​

## B) Implementation phase

Once a strategy/roadmap exists, execution tends to be broken into multiple projects (often with mixed consultant–internal teams):[merkle+2](https://www.merkle.com/en/merkle-now/articles-blogs/2021/Jul/understanding-enterprise-data-platform-key-use-cases-and-architecture.html)​

- Platform and integration build
    - Standing up the core data platform (cloud infra, storage, compute, orchestration, monitoring) and integrating priority source systems.[gable+2](https://www.gable.ai/blog/enterprise-data-platform)​
    - Implementing core data models, pipelines, and quality controls, often around a small number of high‑value use cases or domains as “lighthouse” projects.[sonata-software+1](https://www.sonata-software.com/platformation-services/data-analytics/data-platform-assessment-and-architecture-consulting)​
        
- Data governance, cataloging, and documentation
    - Implementing data catalog / lineage tooling, connecting to source systems, and seeding metadata (including ingesting existing data dictionaries).[elitmind+1](https://www.elitmind.com/offering/data-platform-strategy-consulting)​
    - Establishing practical governance workflows (access requests, change management, quality issue management) and training stewards.[kanerika+1](https://kanerika.com/blogs/data-strategy-consulting/)​
        
- Analytics and enablement
    - Building initial BI dashboards, semantic models, or analytic features that demonstrate value and refine platform requirements.[brisktechsol+1](https://brisktechsol.com/data-strategy-consulting/)​
    - Training internal teams, coaching on best practices, and handing over run‑operations, with decreasing consultant involvement over time.[panoply+1](https://blog.panoply.io/when-to-hire-a-data-consultant)​
        

## How work is spread across projects

In practice, organizations rarely commission “one big project” for an entire enterprise data system; instead they phase it:[analytics8+2](https://www.analytics8.com/blog/elements-of-a-data-strategy/)​

1. Strategy and roadmap project (assessment + target state + business case).
2. Foundation build project(s) for the core platform and first domain(s) or use case(s).
3. Subsequent domain rollouts (e.g., finance, sales, operations, ESG), usually as separate projects or waves.
4. Ongoing optimization, governance, and modernization work, with consultants used more selectively as internal capability grows.[panoply+2](https://blog.panoply.io/when-to-hire-a-data-consultant)​

Given your background, you would typically sit on the client side shaping the roadmap and use cases, while using consultants selectively for architecture accelerators, platform setup, and change‑management heavy pieces.
