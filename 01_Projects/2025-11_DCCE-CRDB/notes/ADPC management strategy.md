- Creagy will adapt to ADPC's work plan and methodology. Since the budget for their task is already low enough. We would not ask them to do more than creating the platform.
- So, we will seek room for complementing their methodology and software work.
- They will go presentation on November 13 2025


ideas about utilizing ADPC's work on climate risk platform
- DCCE-CRDB project will propose a data architecture and produce data assets (data catalog). The climate risk platform is one of the data product that has its own boundary. However, ideally, this product must be integrated in the DCCE data architecture
- The core of the climate adaptation data architecture is the data lakehouse. Ideally, ADPC should use datasets in the central data lakehouse to produce the risk analytics. However, since the data standard for the DCCE data system has not been established yet, the data marts created inside the climate risk platform will serve as groundwork for building the data standard of the DCCE central data system
- in other words, the creation of the climate risk platform's data layer must take the consideration of  the DCCE data lakehouse and data system.

Questions
-  How to make the data marts of the climate risk platform, which are usually transformed and denormalized to optimize reading writing speed for a particular application useful for other projects; CRI, BTR (M&E part), CRDB
- How to integrate this consideration in Coordinated Implementation Plan for the BTR, CRI and CRDB Projects?
