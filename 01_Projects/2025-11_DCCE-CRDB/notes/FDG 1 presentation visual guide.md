Title: Focus Group Discussion #1: Organizing the Adaptation Data House


#### **Slide 1: Status of the House (3 Visualizations)**

Reference: Session 1, Presentation Item 1 (The 3 Visualizations).

Visual Prompt: A slide divided into 3 sections showing the state of the "DCCE House":

1. **What we have:** Show a house layout. There is one small room has partial walls and partitions, and is filled with a few pieces of high-quality furniture (Chairs, Desks, Lamps representing Data Products) that are **scattered** and partially organized. The rest of the space is mostly empty but with scattered clean neat furniture. There are confusing signage such as bath room, living room that is crossed out, wrongly stuck on the wall.  
    
2. **What we are doing:** Show construction workers (The Project Team) inside the Adaptation room. They are measuring the floor and inspecting the furniture. They are **not** demolishing the house, but working on the foundation of this specific room.
    
3. What we miss: Show a ghost image of the "Missing Components" in the Adaptation room—specifically the Interior Design Plan (Framework) and Storage Cabinets (Catalog) that are needed to put the scattered furniture in the right place.
    
    Key Message: We have the house structure and valuable furniture (Data), but we lack the interior design plan for the Adaptation room.
    
    Speaker Notes:

- **What we have:** We aren't starting from zero. We have a solid house. The Mitigation room has made significant progress. The Adaptation room has great furniture (Data Products), but it's messy.
    
- **What we are doing:** We are the architects here to measure the room and check the furniture quality.
    
- **What we miss:** We are missing the "Design Plan" to make this room liveable.
    

#### **Slide 2: The NCAIF Concept (From Mess to Order)**

Reference: Session 1, Presentation Item 2 (Transformation).

Visual Prompt: A "Before and After" transformation diagram:

- **Left Image (The Mess):** The Room with scattered furniture (Data) and confusing signage pointing in random directions. People are tripping over chairs.
    
- **Middle Image (The Blueprint):** A box labeled **"NCAIF"** (National Climate Adaptation Information Framework), visualize it as a **"Blueprint"** or **"Instruction Manual"**.
    
- **Right Image** (The Organized Room): The Blueprint is applied to the room. Now, the chairs are at the tables, the books are on the shelves, and there is clear signage on the doors. The room is tidy and functional. There are a few happy guests visiting the house


Key Message: NCAIF is the Blueprint that organizes the scattered furniture into a usable system.
Speaker Notes:
    
- Imagine NCAIF not as a magic black box, but as the **Blueprint**.
- It takes the scattered items from the left.
- It tells us exactly where to place them (The Right).
- It creates "Zones" for your data: Hazard Zone, Impact Zone
    

#### **Slide 3: The Ecosystem Matrix (What do you have?)**

Reference: Session 2, Presentation Item 1 (The Matrix).

Visual Prompt: A clean 2x3 Matrix Table projected on a whiteboard:

- **Rows:** 1. What we have (As-Is), 2. What we are planning (To-Be).
- Columns: 1. Objective, 2. Product/Output (The Furniture), 3. Target Users (The Residents).
    Key Message: Let's inventory your furniture and your plans.
    Speaker Notes:
    
- We need to fill this table together.
    
- **Row 1:** What furniture is currently in your room? (Current Data).
- **Row 2:** What new furniture are you buying next year? (Future Plans).
- **Columns:** Who sits on this furniture? (Target Users).
    

#### **Slide 4: Pain Points (Living in the House)**

Reference: Session 3, Presentation Item 1-4 (The 4 Problems).

Visual Prompt: A slide with 4 distinct illustrations representing the "Living Experience":

1. **Definitions (Confusion):** Two people in the house pointing at a "Stool". One calls it a "Chair", the other calls it a "Table". They are confused. (Representing semantic conflict).
    
2. **Internal Flow (No Hub):** A person trying to carry a heavy box from the Risk Room to the Policy Room, but there is no door connecting them. They have to climb out the window. (Representing lack of internal API/Hub).
    
3. **External Flow (Barriers):** An outsider knocking on the door to borrow sugar. The resident hands them a 100-page manual instead of the sugar. (Representing difficult discovery/access via MOU).
    
4. Communication (The Gap): A resident showing a complex architectural drawing to a guest, but the guest just wants to know "Is the roof leaking?". The guest walks away confused. (Representing the gap between data products and user understanding).
    
Key Message: These are the daily frustrations of living in a house without a good design.
Speaker Notes:
	- **1. Definitions:** Do we call the furniture by the same name?
	    
	- **2. Internal Flow:** Is it hard to move items between rooms?
	    
	- **3. External Flow:** Is it hard for outsiders to find what they need?
	    
	- **4. Communication:** Are we explaining our data simply enough?
    

#### **Slide 5: Vision & Governance (House Rules)**

**Visual Prompt:** An illustration of a **"Wishlist Board"** or a **"Construction Schedule"** standing in the middle of the Adaptation Room.
- **The Board:** It is covered in sticky notes representing "Dream Scenarios."
- **Note 1 (The Dream):** A picture of a user clicking one button and getting a "Flood Risk Report" instantly. (Label: "Automatic Reporting").
- **Note 2 (The Priority):** A picture of a pipe connecting the "Risk Room" to the "M&E Room" with a "High Priority" stamp. (Label: "Connect Risk to M&E").
- **Note 3 (The Quick Win):** A picture of a dictionary with the words "Risk vs. Vulnerability" highlighted. (Label: "Fix Definitions First"). **Key Message:** We cannot build everything at once. What is your priority use case? **Speaker Notes:**
- **The Wishlist:** If this room was perfectly organized, what is the _first thing_ you would do?
- **Use Case:** Do you want a "One-Click Report"? Or do you want "Automatic Data Sharing" with M&E?
- **Priority:** We can't fix the whole house today. Which specific problem (Pain Point) should we solve _first_ to give you the most value?
