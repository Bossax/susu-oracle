1. 'Open data' leads to a 'data catalog'. The data catalog has categories of datasets
2. sketchy sitemap - สารสนเทศ DCCE has 'CCE center' 'data catalog' , 'risk map'. The risk map can be accessed through the CCE center webpage too. 
3. Portals on the สารสนเทศ DCCE webpage are not strategically aligned to DCCE's staretgy. It is a collage of past work full of random shit
4. 'ศูนย์ข้อมูลกลาง' is more like a web portal to policy and key documents, also to the 'data catalog' landing page. It does not really host datasets.
5. Each platform hosts its own data models (if even exisit), data dictionary, glossary, data storage, and siloed data ingestion - processing steps. Everything is just hosted on CCE website. Who owns CCE though?
