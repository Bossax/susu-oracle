**Subject Area 1: Physical Climate & Hazards**
- **`CLIMATE_SCENARIO`**
    - **Definition:** The hypothetical future pathway (e.g., SSP3-7.0, RCP 8.5) or historical baseline used for simulation.
    - **Business Rule:** Essential for distinguishing "Reference Time" (Model initialization) from "Valid Time" (Forecast target).
        
- **`CLIMATE_DRIVER` (The Continuous Field)**
    - **Definition:** A specific Climatic Impact-Driver (CID) as defined by IPCC AR6 (e.g., Mean Surface Temperature, Sea Level Rise).
    - **Data Nature:** Typically 4D Spatiotemporal Cubes (NetCDF).
    - **Key Distinction:** Represents the _state_ of the system, not a specific disaster instance.
        
- **`HAZARDOUS_EVENT` (The Discrete Object)**
    - **Definition:** A specific, named occurrence (e.g., "Typhoon Yagi", "2024 Phrae Flood") bounded by time and space.
    - **Business Rule:** Must possess a **WMO-CHE UUID** to allow aggregation of disparate local reports into a single synoptic event. This entity is the "Parent" for Loss & Damage records.
        

**Subject Area 2: Exposure & Vulnerability (The System)**
- **`SPATIAL_UNIT`**
    - **Definition:** The common geographic denominator used to link Hazards to Assets.
    - **Strategic Choice:** To solve the $O(n^2)$ computational cost of spatial joins, this should ideally represent a **DGGS Cell** or a standardized Administrative Unit (Level 3).
        
- **`EXPOSED_ASSET`**
    - **Definition:** Elements of society (Population, Infrastructure, Ecosystems) present in hazard zones.
    - **Taxonomy:** Aligned with **GED4ALL** (e.g., Building structural types, Crop varieties).
    - **GHG Synergy (TGEIS Alignment):** This entity doubles as "Activity Data" for GHG inventory (Division 2.1). Attributes must include TGEIS requirements (e.g., Manure management type for livestock, Rice variety for methane calcs) to prevent double-reporting.
        
- **`VULNERABILITY_PROFILE`**
    - **Definition:** The intrinsic predisposition of an asset to be adversely affected.
    - **Logic (ISO 14091):** Derived from the interaction of _Sensitivity_ (e.g., crop heat intolerance) and _Adaptive Capacity_ (e.g., irrigation access).
    - **Constraint:** Separated from Exposure. A house is vulnerable due to its material (wood), regardless of whether it is currently flooded.
        

**Subject Area 3: Outcomes (Risk & Loss)**
- **`RISK_ASSESSMENT` (Probabilistic)**
    - **Definition:** The calculated potential for adverse consequences.
    - **Formula:** $Risk = f(Hazard, Exposure, Vulnerability)$.
    - **Output:** Return periods, Exceedance probabilities, Risk Indices.
        
- **`LOSS_DAMAGE_RECORD` (Deterministic)**
    - **Definition:** Historical, realized impact data linked to Sendai Framework Targets A-D.
    - **Attributes:** Mortality counts, Economic loss (LCU/USD), Infrastructure damage counts.
    - **Linkage:** Must be a child of `HAZARDOUS_EVENT` to enable attribution analysis.

This context informs the existing use cases of climate risk data products to align the CDM to best practices.

The following summary traces the evolution of the CDM, highlighting the specific architectural decisions made to bridge the gap between "Hard Science" rigor and "Soft Science" policy requirements.

| **Phase**                                          | **Use Case Challenge**                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Strategic Modification**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Outcome**                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Initial Foundation** (IVRA-First)             | **Scope Definition:** How to ground the data system in rigorous climate science (IPCC AR6) while acknowledging disaster management needs?                                                                                                 | **Subject Area Definition:** Established the core separation between **Physical Climate** (Probabilistic Potential) and **Discrete Events** (Deterministic Accounting).                                                                                                                                     | A baseline structure rooted in the **IPCC Risk Equation** ($Risk = Hazard \times Exposure \times Vulnerability$) but separated from the **Loss Accounting** domain.         |
| **2. The "Slow-Onset" Fix** (Trends vs. Events)    | **Integration Conflict:** Sendai Reporting requires discrete "Events" (Typhoons), but Climate Science tracks continuous "Drivers" (Sea Level Rise). How to attribute loss to a slow trend without "faking" an event?                      | **Added `ATTRIBUTION_LINK`:** An associative entity that acts as a "Universal Adapter." It allows a `LOSS_DAMAGE_RECORD` to link _either_ to a `HAZARDOUS_EVENT` (Shock) _or_ a `CLIMATE_DRIVER` + `TIME_PERIOD` (Stress).                                                                                  | Solves the **"Semantic Schism."** Prevents the database from being polluted with arbitrary "Fake Events" (e.g., "Drought of 2024") just to satisfy foreign key constraints. |
| **3. The "Soft Science" Fix** (Curves vs. Indices) | **Methodology Conflict:** **CLIMADA** calculates risk using mathematical **Damage Functions** (Curves), whereas the **National CRI** uses **Composite Indices** based on social indicators. The initial model was too rigid to hold both. | **Vulnerability "Strategy Pattern":** Split the Vulnerability entity into two subtypes:<br><br>  <br><br>1. **`IMPACT_FUNCTION`:** Stores math curves (for CLIMADA).<br><br>  <br><br>2. **`VULNERBILITY_COMPONENT`:** Store qualities, variables, statistics that could be used to represent vulnerability | A **Polymorphic Model** that allows the database to store "Hard" actuarial risk models and "Soft" policy scores side-by-side without schema changes.                        |
| **4. The "Fluid Indicator" Fix** (Dynamic Roles)   | **Flexibility Conflict:** In policy maps (DCCE Risk Map), a variable like "Poverty" changes roles—it is **Sensitivity** in one project but **Adaptive Capacity** in another. Hard-coding it breaks flexibility.                           | **Added `VULNERABILITY_DETERMINANT`:** Moved all social variables (Governance, Social, Economic) into a neutral library.<br><br>  <br><br>**Added `FRAMEWORK_MAPPING`:** An entity that assigns roles _dynamically_ to `VULNERABILITY_DETERMINANT` according to `VULNERABILITY_FRAMEWORK`                   | Supports the **Stakeholder-Driven** nature of DCCE work, where indicator lists and groupings are frequently revised.                                                        |
|                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Current State: A "Hybrid" Enterprise Architecture
The CDM has evolved from a purely scientific model into a **Pragmatic Enterprise Solution**. It is now capable of supporting four distinct but interconnected analytical workflows:
1. **Probabilistic Modeling:** via `IMPACT_FUNCTION` $\rightarrow$ `RISK_METRIC`.
2. **Composite Indexing:** via `CAPACITY_FRAMEWORK` $\rightarrow$ `COMPOSITE_INDEX`.
3. **Disaster Accounting:** via `HAZARDOUS_EVENT` $\rightarrow$ `LOSS_DAMAGE_RECORD`.
4. **Trend Attribution:** via `ATTRIBUTION_LINK` $\rightarrow$ `CLIMATE_DRIVER`.


## IVRA Domain ERD

- **Top Left (The Cause):** We have Climate Drivers (Trends) and Hazardous Events (Shocks).
- **Center (The Bridge):** The `ATTRIBUTION_LINK` solves the "Slow Onset" problem. It lets us link a Loss Record to _either_ a specific Typhoon UUID _or_ a general Sea Level Rise trend.
- **Right (The Flexible Vulnerability):** The `VULNERABILITY_DEFINITION` acts as a switch. It allows the system to use "Engineering Curves" (`IMPACT_FUNCTION`) for CLIMADA, or "Social Indicators" (`VULNERABILITY_DETERMINANT`) for the National Climate Risk Index, without breaking the database.

## Associative Entities
## 1)`ATTRIBUTION_LINK`
`{C}ATTRIBUTION_LINK`solves the hardest problem identified in the technical analysis: 
>[!warning] How to store "Slow-Onset" losses (like Sea Level Rise) in a database designed for "Disaster Events" (like Floods).

1. **Why "Attribution"? The Semantic Reason**
	I chose the term **"Attribution"** because it reflects the scientific and policy necessity of **"Event Attribution"** in climate science.
	In the provided documents, there is a fundamental conflict called the "Semantic Schism":

	- **Sendai Framework (The Accountant):** Requires a discrete **"Hazard Event"** with a start/end date (e.g., "Typhoon Yagi") to attach a loss to.
	- **IPCC AR6 (The Scientist):** Recognizes **"Climatic Impact-Drivers" (CIDs)** like Sea Level Rise or Temperature Increase, which are **Continuous Trends**, not discrete events with a simple start date.
    
	**The Problem:** If a farmer loses rice yield due to a 10-year warming trend, there is no "Event UUID" to type into the database. If you force it into a "Event" table, you have to invent arbitrary start/end dates (e.g., "Heatwave of 2024"), which scientifically misrepresents the long-term trend.

	**The Solution:** The **`ATTRIBUTION_LINK`** entity allows the database to formally record the _assertion of cause_. It answers the question: _"To what physical phenomenon do we attribute this specific economic loss?"_

1. **How it reflects in the CDM (The Structure)**
	In data modeling terms, `ATTRIBUTION_LINK` is an **Associative Entity** (sometimes called a Junction Table or Bridge Table). It acts as a "Universal Adapter" that sits between the **Outcome** (Loss) and the **Cause** (Hazard/Driver).
	This structure allows the `LOSS_DAMAGE_RECORD` table to remain clean and standardized (Target A, B, C, D), regardless of whether the cause was a sudden shock or a slow stress.

>[!Comment]
>
>**It supports Polymorphic Causes:**
>- It allows the database to say: "This loss was caused by **Event X**" (Typhoon).
>- _OR_ "This loss was caused by **Driver Y**" (Sea Level Rise) intersecting with this location.
>  
>**It captures "Scientific Confidence":**
>- Attributing a flood to a specific storm is easy (Confidence = 100%).
>- Attributing a crop failure to "Climate Change induced Drought" is a probabilistic assertion
> - The `ATTRIBUTION_LINK` entity can hold an attribute like `Confidence_Level` (e.g., "High Confidence" vs. "Medium Confidence"). A simple foreign key cannot capture this nuance.


## 2) `FRAMEWORK_MAPPING` and `VULNERABILITY_DETERMINANT`

`VULNERABILITY_FRAMEWORK` contains the theory  used to conceptualize vulnerability.
`FRAMEWORK_MAPPING` then contains the implementation of the theory to what group (sensitivity, coping capacity, lack of adaptive capacity, adaptive capacity, transformative capacity, readiness) how the `VULNERABILITY_DETERMINANT` is assigned. 

## Stress test the model 📉
#### Use Case 1: CLIMADA Flood Risk 
- **Input:** `HAZARDOUS_EVENT` (Flood depth raster).
- **Vulnerability:** The system selects a **`VULNERABILITY_DEFINITION`** of type **`IMPACT_FUNCTION`** (e.g., "Depth-Damage Curve ID #55").
- **Process:** It applies the curve coefficients to the raster.
- **Output:** It generates a **`RISK_METRIC`** (e.g., "Expected Annual Damage: $5M").
- _Result:_ Fully compatible with the probabilistic risk logic.
    
#### Use Case 2: National Resilience Index 
- **Input:** `VULNERABILITY_DETERMINANT` (Poverty stats, Governance survey).
- **Vulnerability:** The system selects a **`VULNERABILITY_DEFINITION`** of type **`VULNERABILITY_FRAMEWORK`** (e.g., "National CRI 2026").
- **Process:** It looks up **`FRAMEWORK_MAPPING`** to see that "Governance Survey" is assigned to the "Transformative Capacity" role.
- **Output:** It generates a **`COMPOSITE_INDEX`** (e.g., "Resilience Score: 0.75").
- _Result:_ Fully compatible with the governance/process-oriented frameworks.

# D) Expanded Subject Areas (Feb 10 Update)

Based on benchmarking with **A-PLAT (Japan)**, **KLiVO (Germany)**, and **Climate-ADAPT (EU)**, and analysis of DCCE "Orphaned" products (SAR, Eco-School, T-PLAT), the CDM is expanded into three new domains to bridge the "Science-to-Action" gap.


## 1. Adaptation & Response Domain
*Focus: Transforming risk information into fundable projects and tracking implementation.*
