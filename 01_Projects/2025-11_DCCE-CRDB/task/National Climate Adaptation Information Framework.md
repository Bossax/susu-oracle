# National Climate Adaptation Information Framework (NCAIF) Sitemap v1.0

## 1. Guiding Principle: Sector-First, User-Centric Design

This sitemap merges the "Climate Intelligence Hub" and "NAP Sectoral Navigator" concepts into a single, cohesive user journey. The primary navigation is organized around Thailand's 6 National Adaptation Plan (NAP) sectors, making it immediately relevant to non-technical users from government ministries and sectoral agencies. Deeper scientific data (the "Observatory") is presented as a foundational layer accessible from any point, rather than a separate, siloed section.

## 2. Sitemap Structure

- **Home Page:** High-level overview, key statistics, and entry points into the sectoral pathways.

- **1. Sectoral Adaptation Pathways (NAP-Aligned)**
    - For each of the 6 NAP Sectors (Water, Agriculture, Tourism, Health, Natural Resources, Human Settlements), the structure is identical:
    - **1.1 Sectoral Impacts:** A plain-language summary of the key climate impacts relevant to that sector (e.g., "How will drought affect rice yields in the Chao Phraya Basin?").
        - *Content:* Narratives, key statistics, and visualizations.
        - *CDM Entities:* `RISK_ASSESSMENT` filtered by `EXPOSED_ASSET.sector`, `LOSS_DAMAGE_RECORD`.
    - **1.2 Adaptation Solutions:** A curated library of adaptation options and case studies relevant to the sector.
        - *Content:* Searchable database of solutions, tagged by type (Green, Grey, Soft), cost, and applicability.
        - *CDM Entities:* `ADAPTATION_OPTION` filtered by `sector_id`, linked to `KNOWLEDGE_ASSET` for detailed guides.
    - **1.3 Projects & Progress:** A map and dashboard of ongoing and completed adaptation projects within the sector.
        - *Content:* Interactive map, project profiles, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
        - *CDM Entities:* `ADAPTATION_PROJECT`, `INTERVENTION_RESULT`.

- **2. Climate Observatory (Foundational Data)**
    - This section provides direct access to the underlying climate data for expert users.
    - **2.1 Climate Projections:** Maps and data downloads for future climate scenarios.
        - *Content:* Interactive maps of temperature, rainfall, etc., based on different CMIP6 scenarios.
        - *CDM Entities:* `CLIMATE_SCENARIO`, `CLIMATE_DRIVER`.
    - **2.2 Hazardous Events:** Historical data, trends, and aggregated statistics for extreme events.
        - *Content:* DCCE will provide value by synthesizing data from multiple sources (including DDPM) to offer cross-hazard comparisons, long-term trend analysis, and a unified view of event impacts, rather than just raw event logs. This section will focus on the *statistical patterns* and *analytical insights* derived from raw event data.
        - *CDM Entities:* `HAZARDOUS_EVENT`.

- **3. National Progress (M&E View)**
    - A high-level dashboard summarizing national adaptation progress, rolling up data from all sectors.
    - **3.1 NAP Progress Tracker:** Dashboard showing the status of national adaptation goals.
        - *Content:* Aggregated KPIs from sectoral projects.
        - *CDM Entities:* `INTERVENTION_RESULT` (which improves the score of `COMPOSITE_INDEX`). `RESILIENCE_ASSESSMENT` is the *process or context* within which the composite index is generated. This section will display the *outcomes* (the `COMPOSITE_INDEX` scores) generated by these assessments.
    - **3.2 Case Study Library:** A cross-sector collection of success stories and lessons learned.
        - *Content:* In-depth articles and reports. For now, this content will be managed internally within the NCAIF system if an external CMS (like T-PLAT) is not fully operational. The design will support future integration with an external CMS should one become available, ensuring flexibility and preventing vendor lock-in.
        - *CDM Entities:* `ADAPTATION_PROJECT` linked to `KNOWLEDGE_ASSET` (for internal content management) or `EXTERNAL_CMS_SYSTEM` (for future integration).

- **4. Glossary & Methods:**
    - Provides transparency and builds trust with users.
    - **4.1 Business Glossary:** Definitions of key terms (e.g., "Vulnerability", "Adaptive Capacity").
    - **4.2 Data & Methodology:** Explanation of the data sources, models, and analytical methods used.

## 3. User Journey Example

A user from the Ministry of Agriculture:
1.  Clicks **"Sectoral Pathways" -> "Agriculture"**.
2.  Reads the **"Sectoral Impacts"** page on drought affecting their region.
3.  Explores the **"Adaptation Solutions"** library, filtering for "drought-resistant crops".
4.  Views a **"Case Study"** of a successful project.
5.  Checks the **"Projects & Progress"** map to see if similar projects are happening nearby.

## 4. Alignment with Stakeholder Needs & DCCE Assets

This sitemap directly addresses the needs and leverages the existing assets identified in the `FDG 1 result.md` and other project documentation.

| Stakeholder Need / DCCE Asset | How the Sitemap Addresses It |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Need: Sector-Specific Information** | The entire navigation is built around the 6 NAP sectors, ensuring users from line ministries can immediately find relevant content. |
| **Need: Plain-Language Content** | The "Sectoral Impacts" pages are designed to translate complex risk data into understandable narratives, addressing the feedback that technical terms are too difficult for non-experts. |
| **Need: Link to International Knowledge** | The "Adaptation Solutions" and "Case Study Library" sections provide a clear home for linking to international best practices and knowledge assets, as requested. |
| **Asset: DCCE Risk MAP** | The data from the existing Risk MAP is the engine for the "Sectoral Impacts" and "Climate Observatory" sections. The sitemap provides a user-friendly front-end for this valuable data asset. |
| **Asset: T-Plat.info & Best Practices** | The content from T-Plat.info and various best practice manuals (NbS, Gender) directly populates the "Adaptation Solutions" library. |
| **Asset: M&E Platform Data** | Data from the M&E platform feeds into the "National Progress" and sectoral "Projects & Progress" dashboards, showing the results of adaptation actions. |
| **Need: Clear Definitions (Glossary)** | The dedicated "Glossary & Methods" section directly addresses the critical need for standardized terminology and definitions that was a key finding of FGD 1. |

**Conclusion:** The sitemap is not a theoretical construct; it is a direct response to documented stakeholder needs and is designed to be populated by DCCE's existing and in-development data products. It provides a viable and user-centric pathway for making DCCE's data assets accessible and actionable.

| **Risk Assessment Data Catalog**                       | **2. Climate Observatory** (for raw data underlying hazards and climate projections)<!--comment: No, it actually encompasses exposure and vulnerability too because it must cover every risk determinant--> | Directly informs `CLIMATE_DRIVER`, `HAZARDOUS_EVENT`, and provides detailed metadata for these entities.                                                                                                                       |
|                                                        | **1. Sectoral Adaptation Pathways -> 1.1 Sectoral Impacts** (for contextualizing hazard and exposure data)                                                                                                  | Provides the foundational hazard, exposure, and vulnerability datasets used by `RISK_ASSESSMENT`.                                                                                                                              |
| **Information Product Inventory**                      | **1. Sectoral Adaptation Pathways -> 1.1 Sectoral Impacts** (for displaying results like the Spatial Climate Risk Map)                                                                                      | Represents the 'Gold Layer' data products. These map directly to `RISK_METRIC` and `COMPOSITE_INDEX` entities, with their lineage traceable to the raw data described by the `Risk Assessment Data Catalog`.                   |
|                                                        | **3. National Progress -> 3.1 NAP Progress Tracker**                                                                                                                                                        | Aggregated data products (e.g., resilience scores) feed into high-level dashboards, primarily mapped to `COMPOSITE_INDEX` and `INTERVENTION_RESULT` entities.                                                                  |
| **External System Assets** (M&E/GHG)                   | **3. National Progress -> 3.2 Case Study Library** (for linking to external reports/platforms)                                                                                                              | These are referenced by `EXTERNAL_CMS_SYSTEM` (if external) or integrated via `KNOWLEDGE_ASSET` (if internal). In the CDM, they contribute to the broader 'context' rather than being deeply modeled.                          |
| **Minimum Viable Dataset for Loss & Damage Reporting** | **1. Sectoral Adaptation Pathways -> 1.1 Sectoral Impacts**                                                                                                                                                 | The MVD entities (Event, Impact, Response, Recovery) are directly mapped to `LOSS_DAMAGE_RECORD` and contribute to the understanding of sectoral impacts. This provides the structured data for actual loss and damage events. |
| **Knowledge Synthesis Report**                         | **1. Sectoral Adaptation Pathways -> 1.2 Adaptation Solutions** (for synthesizing best practices and guidelines)                                                                                            | Provides the qualitative content for `ADAPTATION_OPTION` and `KNOWLEDGE_ASSET` entities, offering summaries of studies and reports to guide users towards effective adaptation strategies.                                     |
|                                                        | **4. Glossary & Methods -> 4.2 Data & Methodology**                                                                                                                                                         | Informs the methodological explanations, providing context on how data is synthesized and interpreted within the NCAIF.                                                                                                        |

**Key Takeaway:** The NCAIF Sitemap acts as the user interface for the diverse data assets and knowledge products, with the CDM serving as the underlying engine that structures, links, and makes these disparate pieces of information interoperable and discoverable. The tiered approach ensures that both raw data (via the Observatory) and synthesized insights (via Sectoral Pathways and National Progress) are accessible, aligning with DCCE's role as both 'Architect & Librarian' and 'Data Supplier.'
