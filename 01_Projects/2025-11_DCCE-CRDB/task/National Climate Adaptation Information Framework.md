### NCAIF (Information Framework) = Business Taxonomy

**Purpose:** Help non-technical stakeholders navigate the climate adaptation knowledge domain

>[!note] Structure (Refined from Inception Report Benchmarking):
**NCAIF**
├── Stage 1: Meteorology & Climate (Deep Modeling)
│   ├── Climate Variables (Temperature, Precipitation, Wind) -> Aligned with "Essential Climate Variables" (KlimAdapt)
│   ├── Climate Projections (GCMs, RCPs, Scenarios) -> Integrated with Copernicus-style explorers
│   └── Climate Indices (SPI, ENSO, IOD)
├── Stage 2: Risk & Impact Assessment (IVRA Core)
│   ├── Hazards (Flood, Drought, Heat Wave, Storm, SLR) -> Aligned with ADPC/BTR Hazard List
│   ├── Exposure (Population, Infrastructure, Agriculture, Coastal Assets) -> From DCCE Risk MAP
│   ├── Vulnerability & Sensitivity (Sectoral Factors) -> Refined via NAP 6 Sectors
│   ├── Adaptive Capacity (Local vs. Institutional)
│   └── Impacts (Economic Loss, Casualties, Disruption) -> Linked to Sendai Targets A-G
├── Stage 3: Loss & Damage (MVD Area)
│   ├── Event Metadata (Type, Location, Duration)
│   ├── Impact Metrics (Physical Damage, Economic Loss)
│   └── Response & Recovery (Emergency Measures)
├── Stage 4: Adaptation Measures (Shallow Modeling)
│   ├── Measure Types (NbS, Structural, Policy)
│   └── Sectoral Alignment (NAP 6: Water, Ag, Tourism, Health, Nature, Settlement)
└── Stage 5: Results & M&E (External Integration)
    └── Integration Points for CU Framework (BTR WP-4)
