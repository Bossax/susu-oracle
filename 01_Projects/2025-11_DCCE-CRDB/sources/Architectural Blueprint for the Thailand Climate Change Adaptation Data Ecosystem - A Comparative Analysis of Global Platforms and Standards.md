## 1. Strategic Imperative for a National Climate Data Ecosystem

The global response to climate change has transitioned from a phase of high-level awareness raising to one of urgent, data-driven implementation. For the Kingdom of Thailand, this shift is codified in the establishment of the Department of Climate Change and Environment (DCCE), the drafting of the Climate Change Act, and the operationalization of the National Adaptation Plan (NAP). As the effects of climate change intensify—manifesting in Thailand through increased flood frequency in the Chao Phraya basin, prolonged droughts affecting the agricultural heartlands, and rising sea levels threatening coastal tourism and settlements—the necessity for a robust information infrastructure becomes existential.

This report serves as a foundational architectural document for the design of Thailand’s next-generation climate change adaptation (CCA) data ecosystem. It moves beyond the concept of a static "website" or "portal" to propose a dynamic, interoperable **Data Ecosystem**. This ecosystem must be capable of ingesting heterogeneous data from diverse line ministries, harmonizing it against international standards, and serving actionable intelligence to policymakers, local administrative organizations (LAOs), and the private sector.

### 1.1 The Evolution of Climate Information Platforms

Historically, climate change platforms functioned as digital libraries—repositories of PDF reports and static maps. The first generation of platforms, such as early versions of the UNFCCC’s information portals, focused on document storage. However, the complexity of adaptation, which requires cross-sectoral analysis (e.g., understanding how a drought in the North affects energy production in the Central region), exposed the limitations of this document-centric model.

We are now in the era of **Third-Generation Climate Platforms**, characterized by:

1. **Semantic Interoperability:** The use of machine-readable taxonomies and ontologies to link disparate concepts (e.g., linking "flood defenses" in an engineering database with "disaster risk reduction" in a policy database).
2. **Knowledge Graphs:** Moving from relational tables to graph structures that map complex relationships between hazards, impacts, and adaptation options.
3. **Dynamic Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E):** Real-time tracking of adaptation indicators aligned with global frameworks like the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework.
4. **API-First Design:** Systems designed to consume and expose data programmatically, enabling integration with broader "Big Data" government initiatives.
    

For the DCCE, understanding this evolution is critical. The mandate to establish a **Central Information Center** under the draft Climate Change Act requires a system that is not merely a library, but a regulatory and analytical engine.

### 1.2 The Thai National Context and Institutional Mandate

The design of the data ecosystem must be anchored in Thailand's specific legal and strategic landscape. The DCCE, formerly the Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP), has been elevated to a departmental status to drive the national climate agenda. This institutional restructuring brings new powers and new data responsibilities.

#### 1.2.1 The Climate Change Act and Data Governance

The draft Climate Change Act serves as the legal backbone for the data ecosystem. It mandates the creation of a centralized database to track greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adaptation progress. Critically, it introduces requirements for **mandatory reporting** from designated factories and buildings, creating a high-volume inflow of data that the system must handle. Furthermore, the Act establishes mechanisms for carbon credit tracking to support compliance with **Article 6 of the Paris Agreement**. This requires the data architecture to support high-integrity transaction logging and verification, distinct from but integrated with the adaptation modules.

#### 1.2.2 The National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Priority Sectors

Thailand’s NAP identifies six priority sectors that must form the primary "domains" of the data model. The architecture must explicitly model entities, attributes, and relationships within and across these domains :

1. **Water Resources Management:** This sector requires integration with hydro-meteorological data, specifically flood and drought indices. The system must ingest data from the National Hydroinformatics Data Center and correlate it with adaptation interventions.
    
2. **Agriculture and Food Security:** This domain necessitates data entities related to crop yields, soil moisture, climatic suitability zones, and farmer resilience metrics. The connection between changing rainfall patterns and food security is a primary analytical output.
    
3. **Tourism:** As a critical economic engine, tourism requires risk indices for key destinations. The data model must track infrastructure resilience (e.g., coastal hotels) and "soft" adaptation measures (e.g., tourist safety protocols).
    
4. **Public Health:** This sector requires tracking climate-sensitive disease vectors (e.g., Dengue, Malaria) and heat-related morbidity. The ecosystem must link meteorological data (temperature spikes) with health outcome data.
    
5. **Natural Resource Management:** This involves monitoring forest cover, biodiversity loss, and ecosystem services. The system needs to handle geospatial data layers representing protected areas and carbon sinks.
    
6. **Human Settlements and Security:** This complex domain requires high-resolution urban risk maps, demographic vulnerability data, and infrastructure inventories. It serves the needs of urban planners and LAOs.
    

### 1.3 The Vision: From T-PLAT to a National Intelligence Hub

The current **Thailand Climate Change Adaptation Information Platform (T-PLAT)** serves as a valuable knowledge portal, developed in cooperation with Japan's Ministry of the Environment and linked to the **Asia-Pacific Adaptation Information Platform (AP-PLAT)**. However, it primarily functions as a dissemination channel for information. The vision for the future is to transform T-PLAT into a **National Climate Intelligence Hub**.

This Hub will not only "show" data but "process" it. It will automate the collection of M&E indicators from line ministries, run risk models to generate local hazard maps, and provide a decision-support interface for the allocation of the **Green Climate Fund (GCF)** and domestic budget resources. The realization of this vision requires a deep analysis of global best practices to avoid "reinventing the wheel" and to ensure Thailand's system is interoperable with the global climate data architecture.

## 2. Theoretical Framework: Principles of Climate Data Architecture

Before analyzing specific platforms, it is essential to establish the theoretical principles that underpin modern climate data systems. These principles guide the architectural decisions regarding data modeling, metadata management, and system interoperability.

### 2.1 The FAIR Data Principles

The global scientific and data management community has coalesced around the **FAIR** principles as the standard for data stewardship. For the DCCE ecosystem, adherence to FAIR is not academic; it is a practical requirement to ensure data can be found and used by diverse stakeholders.

- **Findable:** Data and metadata must be assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier (e.g., DOIs or URIs). The system must support rich metadata indexing to ensure users can locate relevant datasets (e.g., finding "Chiang Rai flood risk" without knowing the exact filename).
    
- **Accessible:** Data must be retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol (HTTP/HTTPS). This implies an open API architecture where authentication is handled transparently, allowing authorized users to access data programmatically.
    
- **Interoperable:** Data must use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation. This is where **ontologies** and **controlled vocabularies** (like GEMET or PLACARD) become critical, allowing Thailand's data to be integrated with UN or ASEAN datasets.
    
- **Reusable:** Data must be richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes, including usage licenses and provenance information. This ensures that a risk map generated for 2025 can be correctly interpreted and reused in a 2030 assessment.
    

### 2.2 ISO 14090: Adaptation to Climate Change

**ISO 14090 (Adaptation to climate change — Principles, requirements and guidelines)** provides the logic for the _process_ of adaptation, which must be mirrored in the _structure_ of the data. Unlike a static dataset, adaptation is iterative.

The standard dictates that an organization must:

1. **Assess Impacts:** The data model must store impact assessments, including the methodology and uncertainty levels.
    
2. **Plan Adaptation:** The system must record adaptation plans as distinct entities with objectives and timelines.
    
3. **Implement and Monitor:** The ecosystem must track the status of interventions and measure their effectiveness against a baseline.
    
4. **Evaluate and Learn:** The architecture must support feedback loops, where monitoring data updates the risk assessment for the next cycle.
    

_Architectural Implication:_ The database schema cannot be a flat list of projects. It must model the **Adaptation Cycle**. A "Project" entity must be linked to a "Risk Assessment" entity (pre-project) and an "Evaluation" entity (post-project), allowing the system to query "Which interventions effectively reduced flood risk in the Chao Phraya basin?".

### 2.3 Knowledge Graphs and Semantic Web Technologies

The complexity of climate change, characterized by interconnected systems (e.g., water-energy-food nexus), is poorly served by traditional relational databases (SQL). The emerging standard is the **Knowledge Graph**, which models data as a network of entities (nodes) and relationships (edges).

Using standards like **RDF (Resource Description Framework)** and **OWL (Web Ontology Language)**, a knowledge graph allows the system to infer relationships that are not explicitly stated. For example, if "Drought" affects "Rice Yields," and "Rice Yields" affect "Farmer Income," the graph can infer that "Drought" impacts "Farmer Income." For Thailand, adopting a graph-based approach (or a hybrid relational-graph model) allows for the integration of highly heterogeneous data—from scientific climate models to socio-economic census data—into a unified queryable layer.

## 3. Comparative Analysis of Global Adaptation Platforms

To inform the design of the Thai ecosystem, we conducted a deep-dive analysis of three leading global platforms: **Climate-ADAPT (EU)**, **weADAPT (Global)**, and **UNFCCC NAP Central**. Each represents a different architectural philosophy and serves a distinct user base.

### 3.1 Climate-ADAPT (European Union)

Managed by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Commission, Climate-ADAPT is the premier regional adaptation platform. It supports the EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change and serves as a central reference for member states.

#### 3.1.1 Content Structure and Data Model

Climate-ADAPT utilizes a highly structured, taxonomy-driven database. The content is organized into specific "Item Types," ensuring consistency and comparability across the diverse nations of the EU.

**Core Entities (Data Model):**

The platform's database is built around several primary entities:

- **Adaptation Options:** These describe potential measures (e.g., "Green Roofs," "Managed Realignment"). Each option is an entity with attributes for description, success factors, limiting factors, and costs.
    
- **Case Studies:** These represent the implementation of options. They are strictly linked to specific locations and sectors. The metadata includes fields for "Challenges," "Objectives," "Solutions," and "Relevance".
    
- **Guidance Tools:** Interactive tools like the "Urban Adaptation Support Tool" that guide users through the planning cycle.
    
- **Indicators:** Quantitative datasets tracking climate trends (e.g., "Sea Surface Temperature").
    

**Metadata Schema & Facets:** Climate-ADAPT’s search engine is powered by a comprehensive metadata schema. This is a critical learning point for DCCE: **Discovery depends on Facets.** The platform indexes every item against a controlled vocabulary :

- **Sectors:** A fixed list (Agriculture, Biodiversity, Buildings, Coastal areas, etc.) that users can filter by.
    
- **Climate Impacts:** Specific hazards (Extreme Temperatures, Flooding, Droughts, Storms).
    
- **Transnational Regions:** This facet is unique and highly relevant. It tags content by bio-geographical zones (e.g., Mediterranean, Baltic Sea, Alpine Space). For Thailand, this suggests a need to tag data by **River Basin** (e.g., Chao Phraya, Mekong) or **Eco-region** (e.g., Andaman Coast, Korat Plateau) rather than just administrative province.
    
- **Key Type Measures (KTM):** A classification of the _nature_ of the intervention. Categories include "Green" (ecosystem-based), "Grey" (engineering), and "Soft" (policy/management). This distinction is vital for analyzing the portfolio of adaptation investments.
    

#### 3.1.2 Technical Architecture and Interoperability

Climate-ADAPT is built on a **Plone** content management system (CMS) but has evolved to embrace Semantic Web standards.

- **GEMET Integration:** It uses the **General Multilingual Environmental Thesaurus (GEMET)** for keyword tagging. This ensures that a search for "Flooding" in English retrieves content tagged with "Inondation" (French) or "Überschwemmung" (German). This multilingual capability is directly applicable to the Thai context (Thai/English interoperability).
    
- **SPARQL Endpoint:** The platform exposes its metadata via a SPARQL endpoint, allowing external machines to query the underlying RDF graph. This openness facilitates integration with national portals of EU member states.
    

#### 3.1.3 Strengths and Weaknesses

- **Strengths:** Highly structured data, rigorous quality control (EEA review), strong alignment with EU policy, rich metadata allowing precise filtering.
    
- **Weaknesses:** The rigid structure can make it slow to update. The focus is more on "documents and descriptions" than on dynamic, real-time data streams. It is a "Library of Congress" model—authoritative but heavy.
    

### 3.2 weADAPT (Global / Stockholm Environment Institute)

weADAPT represents a different paradigm. Managed by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), it operates as an "open space" for practitioners, researchers, and policy makers to share knowledge. It is less "top-down" than Climate-ADAPT and more "network-centric".

#### 3.2.1 The "Knowledge Graph" Architecture

weADAPT is a pioneer in applying **Knowledge Graph** technology to climate adaptation. It does not just store documents; it maps the relationships between them to create a "Connectivity Hub".

**Data Model Elements:**

- **Nodes:** The graph consists of diverse node types: _Articles_, _Case Studies_, _Organizations_, _Projects_, _People_, and _Events_.
    
- **Edges (Relationships):** The power lies in the links. A "Case Study" is linked to the "Organization" that implemented it, the "City" where it happened, the "Hazards" it addressed, and the "Methods" used.
    
- **Semantic Tagging:** weADAPT utilizes the **Climate Tagger** API. When a user submits content, the system analyzes the text and automatically suggests semantic tags from a controlled thesaurus (including the PLACARD taxonomy). This automates the classification process and uncovers hidden connections between disparate projects.
    

#### 3.2.2 The PLACARD Taxonomy: Bridging CCA and DRR

A critical innovation within the weADAPT ecosystem is the **PLACARD Taxonomy**. Historically, the Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) communities used different terminologies for overlapping concepts. The PLACARD project developed a harmonized taxonomy to link these domains.

- **Structure:** Hierarchical collection of terms (Concepts).
    
- **Metadata:** Each term includes definitions, synonyms ("hidden labels"), and "related concepts."
    
- **Utility for Thailand:** Thailand’s administration is often split between the DCCE (Climate) and the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (DDPM). Adopting a taxonomy like PLACARD is essential to ensure that flood data from DDPM is semantically compatible with adaptation data from DCCE.
    

#### 3.2.3 Strengths and Weaknesses

- **Strengths:** Excellent discovery capabilities through the graph interface ("Who is doing what where?"). Highly collaborative and agile. Supports "bottom-up" knowledge generation.
    
- **Weaknesses:** Variable data quality due to user generation. Less focus on regulatory compliance or standardized national reporting.
    

### 3.3 UNFCCC NAP Central

NAP Central serves as the official repository for National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) submitted to the UNFCCC. It is the global system of record for national adaptation planning.

#### 3.3.1 Structure and Data Limitations

NAP Central functions primarily as a document repository.

- **Entities:** _Parties_ (Countries), _NAP Documents_, _Sectoral NAPs_.
    
- **Attributes:** Submission Date, Region, Version.
    
- **Data Extraction (NAP Trends):** Recognizing the limitation of PDFs, the **NAP Trends** initiative attempts to extract structured data from these documents to answer questions like "How many NAPs prioritize gender?" or "Which sectors are most funded?".
    

#### 3.3.2 Strategic Relevance

While its architecture is less advanced than weADAPT, NAP Central sets the **content standard**. The categories it uses for reporting (e.g., the specific sector definitions, the requirement for "implementation strategies") define the data fields that Thailand’s T-PLAT must populate to generate its NAP reports automatically.

- **Weakness:** The heavy reliance on unstructured PDF documents makes automated analysis difficult. This serves as a cautionary tale for DCCE: **Avoid designing T-PLAT as a PDF archive.** Data should be captured in structured formats (web forms) at the source to enable downstream analytics.

## 4. Assessment of Thailand’s T-PLAT and Digital Landscape

Having analyzed global benchmarks, we turn to the current state of Thailand’s infrastructure. The **Thailand Climate Change Adaptation Information Platform (T-PLAT)** is the existing national portal.

### 4.1 Current Architecture and Functionality

T-PLAT was established with support from Japan’s Ministry of the Environment to link with the regional **AP-PLAT**. Its primary function has been to disseminate information on climate risks and adaptation measures across the six NAP sectors.

- **Content:** It hosts information on climate projections (downscaled for Thailand), risk maps, and sectoral guidance.
    
- **Integration:** It serves as a node in the ASEAN climate knowledge network, facilitating data sharing with AP-PLAT.
    
- **Gap Analysis:** Currently, T-PLAT operates largely as a "content management system" for static information. It lacks the interactive M&E capabilities required by the new Climate Change Act. It does not yet have a robust **API layer** for third-party developers, nor does it have a fully automated data ingestion pipeline from line ministries. The data flow is often manual and document-based.
    

### 4.2 The Mandate for a "Central Information Center"

The draft Climate Change Act explicitly mandates a **Central Information Center**. This legal requirement fundamentally shifts the scope of T-PLAT from "Information Dissemination" to "Regulatory Compliance and Intelligence".

**New Requirements Imposed by the Act:**

1. **GHG Inventory & MRV:** A rigorous system to track emissions from point sources (factories, energy plants).
    
2. **Adaptation M&E:** A system to track the _effectiveness_ of adaptation measures, not just their existence. This requires defining indicators (e.g., "Reduction in flood damages in Baht") and collecting data annually.
    
3. **Carbon Credit Registry:** A secure ledger for Article 6 compliance, ensuring no double-counting of credits.
    
4. **Spatial Risk Data (Risk MAP):** The Act calls for the development of a spatial database for climate risk, which must integrate with the broader **One Map** policy of the Thai government.
    

---

## 5. Ontological Alignment and Semantic Interoperability

To build a "Third-Generation" platform, DCCE must move beyond simple database schemas to **Ontologies**. An ontology defines the concepts and relationships in a domain, allowing the computer to "understand" the data.

### 5.1 The Semantic Gap: CCA vs. DRR

A major challenge in Thailand is the fragmentation between agencies. The Royal Irrigation Department (RID) manages "floods" as hydrological events; the DDPM manages them as "disasters"; the DCCE manages them as "climate impacts." Without a shared ontology, data from these agencies cannot be combined.

**The Solution: A Harmonized Thai Climate Ontology.**

We recommend adopting the **PLACARD** approach to map these terms.

- _Concept:_ `Flood`
    
- _CCA Term (DCCE):_ `Climate Impact > Extreme Precipitation`
    
- _DRR Term (DDPM):_ `Hazard > Hydrological > Flood`
    
- _Thai Term:_ `อุทกภัย (Uthok-ka-phai)`
    

By implementing a **SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)** thesaurus that maps these terms, T-PLAT can serve as a translator. A query for "Climate Adaptation Projects" can automatically retrieve "Flood Prevention Infrastructure" data from the RID database.

### 5.2 Adopting GEMET and IPCC Definitions

To ensure international interoperability (with EU and UN systems), the Thai ontology should be mapped to:

- **GEMET (General Multilingual Environmental Thesaurus):** For general environmental terms. This aligns T-PLAT with Climate-ADAPT.
    
- **IPCC AR6 Glossary:** For scientific precision. Terms like "Resilience," "Vulnerability," and "Exposure" must be defined strictly according to IPCC AR6 Annex II definitions to ensure scientific validity.
    
- **Climatic Impact-Drivers (CIDs):** The taxonomy of hazards (e.g., "Mean Surface Temperature," "Extreme Heat") should strictly follow the IPCC AR6 CID framework.

## 6. Proposed Architectural Blueprint

Based on the research, we propose a comprehensive **Data Ecosystem Architecture** for the DCCE. This architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and standards-compliant.

### 6.1 Conceptual Data Model

The heart of the system is the Data Model. We propose a relational model extended with graph capabilities, centering on four primary entities: **Hazard**, **Asset**, **Action**, and **Indicator**.

#### 6.1.1 Entity: Climate Hazard (Risk)

Represents the physical threat.

- **Attributes:** `Hazard_ID`, `CID_Type` (linked to IPCC taxonomy), `Intensity`, `Probability` (Return Period), `Spatial_Extent` (GeoJSON), `Scenario` (e.g., RCP4.5 / SSP2-4.5).
    
- **Source:** Downscaled climate models (CMIP6) from the Climate Change Data Center.
    

#### 6.1.2 Entity: Vulnerable Asset (Exposure)

Represents what is at risk.

- **Attributes:** `Asset_ID`, `Sector` (linked to NAP Sectors), `Location` (Coordinates), `Value` (Economic/Social), `Vulnerability_Score`.
    
- **Examples:** Rice paddies (Agriculture), Hospitals (Public Health), Hotels (Tourism).
    

#### 6.1.3 Entity: Adaptation Action (Response)

Represents the intervention.

- **Attributes:** `Action_ID`, `Type` (KTM: Green/Grey/Soft), `Status` (Planned/Ongoing/Complete), `Budget`, `Implementing_Agency`.
    
- **Alignment:** Mapped to ISO 14090 adaptation planning steps.
    

#### 6.1.4 Entity: Indicator (M&E)

Represents the measurement of success.

- **Attributes:** `Indicator_ID`, `Metric_Name`, `Unit`, `Baseline_Value`, `Target_Value`, `Current_Value`, `Reporting_Period`.
    
- **Alignment:** Mapped to SDG 13 and Sendai Framework Targets.
    

### 6.2 Logical Architecture: The "Lakehouse" Concept

To handle the volume and variety of data (documents, tables, geospatial rasters), we recommend a **Data Lakehouse** architecture.

|**Layer**|**Component**|**Function**|**Technology Example**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Ingestion Layer**|**API Gateway**|Secure entry point for data from Line Ministries and IoT sensors.|Kong, AWS API Gateway|
||**e-Reporting Portal**|Web forms for manual data entry (Factories, Provinces).|React, Angular|
|**Storage Layer**|**Data Lake**|Raw storage for unstructured data (PDFs, Satellite Images).|S3, Azure Blob|
||**Data Warehouse**|Structured storage for indicators and registry data.|PostgreSQL, BigQuery|
|**Semantic Layer**|**Knowledge Graph**|Maps relationships and ontologies (The "Brain").|Neo4j, Apache Jena|
||**Vocabulary Server**|Hosts the Thai Climate Thesaurus (SKOS).|VocBench|
|**Service Layer**|**Geospatial Engine**|Serves map layers (WMS/WFS).|GeoServer, ESRI Enterprise|
||**Analytics Engine**|Runs risk models and aggregates M&E data.|Python, R|
|**Presentation Layer**|**T-PLAT Portal**|Public dashboard and stakeholder interfaces.|Web Frontend|
||**Open Data API**|Public access for researchers and developers.|Swagger/OpenAPI|

### 6.3 Interoperability Standards

To ensure the ecosystem can "talk" to the world:

- **Metadata:** Use **DCAT-AP** (Data Catalog Vocabulary) to describe datasets, making them discoverable by Google and AP-PLAT.
    
- **Geospatial:** Adhere to **OGC** standards (WMS, WFS, NetCDF) for all map data.
    
- **API:** Use **OpenAPI (Swagger)** specifications for all REST endpoints.
    

---

## 7. Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E): The Core Engine

The transition to a "Central Information Center" hinges on the ability to monitor progress. The current lack of a unified M&E system is a critical gap.

### 7.1 Designing SMART Indicators

The data ecosystem must enforce the creation of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) indicators. These should be hierarchical:

1. **National Indicators:** Aggregate metrics for reporting to Government and UNFCCC (e.g., "Total GHG Emissions," "National Vulnerability Index").
    
2. **Sectoral Indicators:** Specific to NAP sectors (e.g., "Crop yield loss due to drought," "Dengue incidence rate").
    
3. **Project Indicators:** Output-level metrics (e.g., "Meters of sea wall built," "Number of farmers trained").
    

### 7.2 Automated Reporting Pipelines (MRV)

To reduce the burden on government officials, the system must automate MRV (Measurement, Reporting, Verification).

- **Input:** Line ministries submit data via API or Excel upload templates validated against the schema.
    
- **Processing:** The system automatically checks for anomalies (e.g., values outside historical ranges).
    
- **Output:** Automated generation of the **Biennial Transparency Report (BTR)** tables required by the Paris Agreement.
    

---

## 8. Operationalizing the Ecosystem: Use Cases

To demonstrate the practical value of this architecture, we define three core use cases.

### 8.1 Use Case A: Provincial Adaptation Planning (Local Government)

- **Actor:** Policy Planner in a flood-prone province (e.g., Ayutthaya).
    
- **Need:** Develop a provincial adaptation plan integrated with the national strategy.
    
- **System Interaction:**
    
    1. User logs into **T-PLAT**.
        
    2. Accesses **Risk MAP** to view downscaled flood projections for 2030 and 2050 (SSP2-4.5).
        
    3. Overlays the "Vulnerable Settlements" layer (Human Settlement Sector) to identify at-risk communities.
        
    4. Queries the **Adaptation Option Database** for "Flood Management" solutions, filtering by "Green Infrastructure" (KTM).
        
    5. Selects a "Constructed Wetland" option. The system auto-populates a "Project Concept Note" with standard indicators (ISO 14090 aligned).
        
- **Outcome:** A data-driven provincial plan that is automatically aligned with national NAP targets.
    

### 8.2 Use Case B: National GCF Funding Proposal (DCCE)

- **Actor:** DCCE Fund Manager.
    
- **Need:** Secure Green Climate Fund (GCF) financing for a cross-sectoral water project.
    
- **System Interaction:**
    
    1. User queries the **Knowledge Graph** for "Water Scarcity" impacts in the Northeast.
        
    2. The graph retrieves linked data: Meteorological drought indices (Water Sector), Crop yield declines (Ag Sector), and Poverty rates (Socio-economic data).
        
    3. System generates a "Climate Rationale" report visualizing the causal links between climate change and economic loss.
        
    4. User selects proposed interventions. The system simulates potential "Impact Indicators" (e.g., "Beneficiaries: 50,000 households").
        
- **Outcome:** A high-quality, evidence-based funding proposal that meets GCF's rigorous data standards.
    

### 8.3 Use Case C: Private Sector Disclosure (Corporate)

- **Actor:** Sustainability Officer at a major agro-industrial firm.
    
- **Need:** Report climate risks as mandated by the Climate Change Act.
    
- **System Interaction:**
    
    1. User accesses the **Open Data API**.
        
    2. Retrieves official "Hazard Exposure Scores" for the company's factory locations.
        
    3. Submits the company's adaptation plan via the **e-Reporting Portal**.
        
    4. The system validates the submission and issues a "Compliance Certificate."
        
- **Outcome:** Regulatory compliance for the firm and high-resolution private sector data for the government.
    

---

## 9. Implementation Roadmap

Building this ecosystem is a multi-year journey. We recommend a phased approach.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Year 1)

- Establish the **Data Governance Board** within DCCE.
    
- Define the **Thai Climate Taxonomy** (SKOS) and map it to PLACARD/GEMET.

## 10. Conclusion

The Department of Climate Change and Environment stands at the threshold of a digital transformation. The transition from T-PLAT as a "website" to T-PLAT as a **National Climate Data Ecosystem** is essential for Thailand to meet its "Net Zero 2065" goals and protect its people from the escalating climate crisis.

By adopting a **Knowledge Graph** architecture, aligning with **ISO 14090** and **IPCC** standards, and bridging the semantic gap between CCA and DRR, Thailand can build a system that is world-class. This ecosystem will not only satisfy the regulatory mandates of the Climate Change Act but will empower decision-makers at every level—from the Prime Minister’s office to the village headman—with the intelligence they need to build a resilient future.

**The blueprint is clear: Standardize, Connect, and Empower.**
