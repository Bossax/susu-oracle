## 3. Operational Governance and Capacity Building

### Governance Activities (FY 2019 - 2020)

The data ecosystem is supported by a robust governance framework ensuring stakeholder alignment and technical validation:

- **Steering Committee (SC):**
    
    - 2nd Meeting: January 2019.
        
    - 3rd Meeting: August 2019.
        
- **Working Group (WG):**
    
    - 2nd Meeting: July 2019.
        
    - 3rd Meeting: January 2020.
        

### Capacity Building (Humanware)

To ensure effective data utilization, the ecosystem includes training components:

- **G-ToT (Green Training of Trainers):** Workshop on Climate Change Adaptation held in February 2020.
    
- **Site Visits:** Field operations in Chiang Rai (January 2020).

## 4. Organizational Architecture

The platform's governance structure ensures a clear flow of authority, technical input, and implementation duties.

> Architectural Diagram Description: T-PLAT Organizational Structure
> 
> - **Strategic Oversight:** A collaborative **Project Management** layer led by **MOEJ** (Japan) and **MONRE/ONEP** (Thailand).
>     
> - **Advisory Layer:** A **Steering Committee** and a **Working Group** provide strategic direction and technical validation.
>     
> - **Implementation Core:**
>     
>     - The **Secretariat (ERTC / DEQP)** acts as the central node for "Output 2: Self Data Management."
>         
>     - **MOEJ Consultants** provide advisory coordination and "Output 1: Info. Structure Development."
>         
> - **Data Inputs (Supply Side):**
>     
>     - **Academic/Research Nodes:** Kasetsart Univ., Tokyo Univ., JICA, JST, and other research institutes feed data (e.g., from IMPAC-T / ADAP-T projects) into the platform.
>         
>     - **Government Data Holders:** Related technical departments and ministries.
>         
> - **Outputs (Demand Side):**
>     
>     - "Output 3: Info Dissemination" distributes intelligence to Thailand, ASEAN, and the international society.
>

## 5. Information Architecture: Digital Interface

### Website Deployment

The digital front-end is live at `t-plat.deqp.go.th`, serving as the primary interface for data dissemination.

### Content Strategy (Sitemap)

The information architecture is categorized into three primary domains:

1. **Climate Information:**
    
    - Future climate projections.
        
    - Meteorological data.
        
2. **Impact Information:**
    
    - Sector-specific risk assessments (e.g., Agriculture, Water Management).
        
3. **Adaptation Information:**
    
    - **Actionable Content:** Infographics and articles tailored for general public consumption.
        
    - **Policy Support:** Resources aligning with the National Adaptation Plan (NAP).

## 6. Future Architecture: "T-PLAT +" and AP-PLAT Integration

### Concept: "T-PLAT +"

The platform is evolving from a static information repository to a dynamic action enabler.

> Architectural Diagram Description: T-PLAT + Concept This conceptual model illustrates the transformation of data into action:
> 
> - **Input Layer:** "Scientific Knowledge" (Observation, Projection, Impact Assessment).
>     
> - **Processing Layer:** The T-PLAT platform integrates this knowledge.
>     
> - **Output Layer:** "Actions" by stakeholders, including:
>     
>     - Policymakers (National/Local).
>         
>     - Private Sector/Business.
>         
>     - Citizens/NGOs.
>         
> - **Value Proposition:** The platform bridges the gap between raw science and practical implementation.
>     

### Regional Integration (AP-PLAT)

T-PLAT acts as a national node contributing to the regional **AP-PLAT** ecosystem.

> Architectural Diagram Description: AP-PLAT Ecosystem
> 
> - **Core Platform:** AP-PLAT (Asia-Pacific Climate Change Adaptation Information Platform) serves as the regional aggregator.
>     
> - **Functional Pillars:**
>     
>     1. **Scientific Information:** Data infrastructure.
>         
>     2. **Support Tools:** Toolkits for decision-making.
>         
>     3. **Capacity Building:** Training and network development.
>         
> - **Goal:** To support effective climate risk management and resilience across the Asia-Pacific region by 2020.
>     

### Next Steps (Action Items)

1. **Private Sector Engagement:** Develop a specific "Business Sector" interface to support private sector adaptation.
    
2. **Content Expansion:** Continue populating the platform with updated research and adaptation articles.
    
3. **System Enhancement:** Upgrade to "T-PLAT +" functionalities to support direct stakeholder action.
