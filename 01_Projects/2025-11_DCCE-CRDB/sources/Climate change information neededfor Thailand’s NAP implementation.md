## 1. Climate Change Policies and Plans

### National Strategy (2018-2037)

- **Vision:** "Security, Prosperity, Sustainability" to become a developed country according to the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy.
- **Strategy 5:** Eco-Friendly Development and Growth.
    
    - Indicator: Proportion of Renewable Energy consumption; Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reduction.
        

### Climate Change Master Plan (2015-2050)

- **Vision:** Thailand is resilient to climate change impacts and moves towards low carbon and sustainable growth.
    
- **Missions:**
    
    1. Building climate resilience (Adaptation).
        
    2. Reducing GHG emissions (Mitigation).
        
    3. Capacity building and management (Enabling Environment).
        
- **Targets:**
    
    - **Short-term (2016-2020):** NAMA Targets (Energy & Transport).
        
    - **Medium-term (2021-2030):** NDC Targets (Economy-wide).
        
    - **Long-term (2031-2050):** Towards Low Carbon Society.

## 2. Thailand’s NAMAs (Pre-2020)

**Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs)**

- **Target:** Reduce GHG emissions by **7% to 20%** below Business as Usual (BAU) in Energy and Transport sectors by 2020.
    
- **Achievement (2017):**
    
    - Achieved **14.5%** reduction (52.26 MtCO2eq).
        
    - Measures included Renewable Energy (RE), Energy Efficiency (EE), and Bio-fuels.

## 3. Thailand’s NDCs (Post-2020)

**Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)**

- **Submission:** Submitted to UNFCCC on 21 September 2015.
    
- **Target:** Reduce GHG emissions by **20% (Unconditional)** to **25% (Conditional)** from BAU levels by 2030.
    
- **BAU 2030 Projection:** Approx. 555 MtCO2eq.
    
- **Reduction Amount:** 111 MtCO2eq (20%) to 139 MtCO2eq (25%).
    
- **Coverage:** Economy-wide (Energy, Transport, Waste, IPPU).

## 4. NDC Roadmap (Mitigation 2021-2030)

The roadmap outlines measures across key sectors to achieve the 20% reduction target (115.6 MtCO2eq).

### Sectoral Breakdown

|**Sector**|**Measures / Focus Areas**|**Estimated Reduction (MtCO2eq)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Energy**|**Renewable Energy (RE):** Biogas, Biomass, Solar, Wind, Hydro, Waste-to-Energy.<br><br>  <br><br>**Energy Efficiency (EE):** Heat/Electricity generation, Households, Buildings, Industry.|**76.0** (RE: 24.3, EE: 51.7)|
|**Transport**|Energy efficiency in transport, Bio-fuels, Public transportation expansion (Rail), Vehicle tax reform.|**31.0**|
|**Waste**|Waste management (Municipal Solid Waste), Wastewater treatment, Biogas from waste.|**5.2**|
|**IPPU**|Clinker substitution in cement production, Refrigerant management.|**3.4**|
|**Total**||**115.6**|

## 5. Adaptation (National Adaptation Plan - NAP)

**Goal:** To ensure Thailand is resilient to climate change impacts.

### 6 Priority Sectors:

1. **Water Resources Management:** Flood and drought management.
    
2. **Agriculture and Food Security:** Climate-smart agriculture, crop diversification.
    
3. **Tourism:** Sustainable tourism, eco-tourism.
    
4. **Public Health:** Disease surveillance, health promotion.
    
5. **Natural Resources Management:** Forestry, biodiversity conservation.
    
6. **Human Settlements and Security:** Urban planning, infrastructure resilience.

## 6. Implementation Mechanism

### Institutional Arrangement

- **National Committee on Climate Change (NCCC):** Chaired by the Prime Minister.
    
- **Sub-Committees:**
    
    - Climate Change Policy and Integrated Planning.
        
    - Knowledge and Database.
        
    - Climate Change Negotiation.
        
- **Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP):** Secretariat and National Focal Point.
    

### Legal Framework (Draft Climate Change Act)

- **Objective:** To provide a legal basis for climate action, including mandatory reporting (MRV) and financial mechanisms.
    
- **Key Components:**
    
    - GHG Reporting System.
        
    - Climate Change Fund.
        
    - Market-based Mechanisms (Carbon Credit/Tax).
        

### Support Needs

- **Finance:** Access to international climate finance (GCF, GEF).
    
- **Technology:** Technology transfer and development (e.g., Energy storage, EV, CCS).
    
- **Capacity Building:** Training for personnel, public awareness.
