Based on the presentation "Tokyo_T-PLAT_presentation.pdf," here is the converted content in Markdown format. I have structured this as a strategic data architecture overview for the T-PLAT ecosystem.



**Presenter:** Atsamon Limsakul, Environmental Research and Training Center (ERTC), Department of Environmental Quality Promotion (DEQP) **Date:** 3 December 2018 **Event:** Adaptation Platform Meeting, Tokyo, Japan

## 1. Executive Summary and Strategic Context

### Background and Purpose

In response to the implementation of the Paris Agreement, there is a critical need for a centralized platform to support the effective integration and dissemination of climate change risk and adaptation information. This infrastructure aims to support both high-level policy-making and localized actions.

This initiative aligns with the establishment of the **Asia-Pacific Adaptation Information Platform (AP-PLAT)** by the Ministry of the Environment of Japan (MOEJ), scheduled for full operation by 2020, to facilitate the sharing of climate risk information at the regional level.

## 2. Conceptual Data Framework

The platform is designed around a linear transformation pipeline that converts raw climate data into societal value.

> **Architectural Diagram Description: Data and Information Flow** The architecture bridges the gap between the **Climate** domain and the **Society** domain through a structured data lifecycle: 1. **Data Ingestion:** The process begins with **Obtaining** raw data. 2. **Integration:** Data undergoes **Assimilation** and **Processing**. 3. **Knowledge Production:** * The core processing unit performs **Analysis** to generate **Knowledge and Information Production**. * This feeds into **Basic & Applied Research** (producing Papers/Books) and **Climate Information Services** (producing Climate Information Products). * Technical support is provided via **Technic & Scientific Assistance** (Workshops, Guidelines, Consultancy). 4. **Dissemination:** The final stage distributes actionable intelligence to society.
> 
> **Core Logic:** Data + Knowledge = Information.

## 3. Platform Ecosystem and Connectivity

T-PLAT operates as the national node within a broader regional network.

> **Architectural Diagram Description: T-PLAT Ecosystem**
> 
> **T-PLAT** functions as the central hub connecting domestic and international data streams:
> 
> - **International/Regional Layer:** * Bidirectional connection with **AP-PLAT**. * Ingestion of climate data/research outputs from Southeast Asia and other regions. * Data exchange with Southeast Asian countries.
>     
> - **National Layer (Thailand):** * Ingestion of domestic climate data and research outputs. * Identification of knowledge and research needs via the Research Network.
>     
> - **Application Layer:** * The platform supports **NAP (National Adaptation Plan) implementation**. * It archives and disseminates **Good practices/lessons learned**. * It facilitates **Local actions**.
>

> 
> - **Implementation Unit:** * **Working Group:** coordinates operational tasks. * **Secretariat (ERTC/DEQP):** Manages the central node. * **Consultant (MOEJ):** Provides advisory coordination and data co-designing/re-processing support.
>     
> - **Data Sources & Development Partners:** * **Data Holders:** Technical Departments and Ministries. * **Development Partners:** Includes Kasetsart Univ., Tokyo Univ., JICA, JST, and other research institutes (providing outputs from IMPAC-T / ADAP-T projects).
>     
> - **Operational Outputs:**
>     
>     1. Info. Structure Development: Integrating data from partners. 2. **Self Data Management:** Managed by the Secretariat. 3. **Info Dissemination:** Distributing to Thailand, ASEAN, and the International Society.
>
