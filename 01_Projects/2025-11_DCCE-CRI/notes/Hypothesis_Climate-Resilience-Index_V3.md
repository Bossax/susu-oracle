# Context
LAO =-= Local Administrative Organizations. including
- Municipalities of various sizes
- Provincial Administrative Organization

DCCE = Department of Climate Change and Environment

- LAOs are incentivized to collect and report 20 plus datasets. Three of these are required by DCCE; Sustainable City Assessment, Green Area Database, and GHG inventory 
- LAOs are incentivized to make Smart City Plan, Climate Change management plan (mitigation and adaptation), Disaster prevention and mitigation plan, Water management plan

**Interim ideas**
- [x] What datasets that are collected and reported by LAOs as part of LPA could be used for CRI? 

- Think about incentive mechanisms of data reporting. 
- [ ] What incentivizes LAOs to collect and report data other than legal mandates? How can CRI improve the experience of LAOs in data collection and data analytics?

- [ ] as part of Sustainable City assessment by DCCE, there is an assessment mechanism in place.
	- [ ] The data reporting platform
	- [ ] The Area-Level Sustainable Environmental City Sub-committee (covering regions such as North, Northeast, Central, East, and South) is responsible for area-level assessment via vdo call, including online presentation.
	- [ ] The National-Level Sustainable Environmental City Sub-committee, categorized by municipality type (City, Town, and Sub-district Municipalities) further assess best performer who received "excellent" rating from the regional assessment. The assessment involves online presentation and site visit. 


# Potential project directions
## 1st track CRI = Climate Risk Index

ex-post climate impact based on SENDAI frame work indicators. for example,
- number of affected people
- number of affected agricultural land
- disaster relief payment

The data is at provincial level. The weighting scheme is equal weighting. Data is from national census database.

The result yields different spatial pattern as compared to the **spatial risk map.**

While the general trend is in agreement. e. g. the northeastern region has suffered the most economic damage and casualty, the results at the provincial level disagree. For example, the provinces that faces the highest risk and suffers the most impact are different provinces.

### Question
1. How to interpret this disparity?
2. is the regional similarity result from methodology similarity or result convergence?
	- the spatial risk map does include an overlapping set of indicators with the CRI
	- CRI could be biased due to data availability. Because CRI roughly separates economic damage aggregation by agricultural zone and non-agricultural zone, the data incompleteness of industrial and urban areas damage may skew the result.

### Possibility of project value added

1. Address the interpretability and synergy with the spatial risk map
2. Dasymetization methodology to improve data resolution
3. Establish data architecture for CRI, focusing on practi­cality.

## 2nd Track CRI = Climate Resilience Index

Focus on actionability of the information

**key word**: co-creation process . local administration and authority

The project will base on

1. local performance assessment.
	- Annual assessment mandated by the Ministry of Interior.

2. Sustainable city assessment
	- DCCE voluntary city assessment program

**We could**
1. select existing indicators to enhance with climate lens.
2. propose methodological changes to the definitions of the indicators and data collection.
3. Interpretability and actionability of CRI in conjunction with the spatial risk map.
4. linkage with action support tools.
	- TEI climate adaptation concepts and approaches\
	-  Adaptation finance source tool.
