## **1. Overview**

Thailand’s climate governance operates within a **multi-level administrative system** that connects national strategies to local implementation through structured planning, budgeting, and coordination mechanisms.  
The **Climate Resilience Index (CRI)** will need to fit into this existing system — complementing national monitoring functions while empowering **local governments (LGUs)** as the primary users and implementers of resilience actions.



## **2. Multi-Level Governance Architecture**

Thailand’s development and adaptation processes are guided by the principle of **“One Plan”**, which promotes **vertical and horizontal alignment** across national, regional, provincial, and local levels.  
Key coordinating committees ensure coherence between these scales:

| Level          | Main Actors                                                                                                                             | Key Mechanisms and Committees                                     | Planning Instruments                                                                                      |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **National**   | National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC), Department of Climate Change and Environment (DCCE), relevant line ministries | Committee on Integrated Area-Based Administration Policy (ก.น.บ.) | 20-Year National Strategy, National Economic and Social Development Plan, National Adaptation Plan (NAP)  |
| **Regional**   | Sectoral ministries, Regional Coordination Hubs                                                                                         | Group of Provinces Committee (ก.บ.ก.)                             | Regional Adaptation Strategies (RAS)                                                                      |
| **Provincial** | Governors, Provincial Administrative Organizations (PAO), Provincial Offices of sectoral ministries                                     | Provincial Committee on Integrated Administration (ก.บ.จ.)        | Provincial Development Plan (PDP), Provincial Adaptation Guidelines (PAG), Provincial Risk Profiles (PRP) |
| **Local**      | Municipalities, Subdistrict Administrative Organizations (SAOs)                                                                         | District and Subdistrict Committees (ก.บ.อ., ก.บ.ต.)              | Local Development Plans, Municipal Risk Profiles (MRP)                                                    |

This multi-level structure already provides a **channel for cascading adaptation information** and **aggregating local data upward**.  
However, coherence across levels remains weak, with fragmented data systems, inconsistent indicators, and limited fiscal autonomy at the local level.



## **3. Roles and Responsibilities**

### **National Level**

- **DCCE (Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment; MNRE)**: Leads national climate change management, maintains the NAP, develops data frameworks, and coordinates adaptation policies.
    
- **NESDC (Office of Prime Minister)**: Integrates climate resilience into development planning guidelines and monitors implementation progress.
    
- **TMD (under Ministry of Digital Economy)**:  provides climate services and technical data for impact modeling and early warning.

- DDPM **(under the ministry of Interior**): drive disaster risk reduction and preparedness policy, collect disaster related statistics
    

### **Provincial Level**

- **Governor** chairs the Provincial Climate Change Board and oversees the development of  **Provincial Risk Profiles (PRP)** and Climate Change management plan as mandated by .
    
- **PAOs** act as intermediaries, managing infrastructure, health, and environmental programs, and coordinating with municipalities for implementation.
    
- **Provincial Development Plans (PDPs)** integrate inputs from local plans under the “One Plan” mechanism.
    

### **Local Level**

- **Municipalities ** are directly responsible for localized adaptation actions — flood drainage, water supply, community preparedness, and local infrastructure.
    
- They develop **Local Development Plans**, often under technical guidance from PAOs or provincial offices.
    
- Their budgets come mainly from **central government transfers**, which constrains flexibility for climate investments.

## **4. Planning and Budgeting Processes**

Planning is structured into interlinked cycles:

1. **National level** sets priorities through the 20-Year National Strategy and NESDP.
    
2. **Provinces** consolidate inputs from municipalities and line agencies into a **Provincial Development Plan**.
    
3. **Local governments** develop 5-year and annual **Local Development Plans**, aligning with the provincial plan and sectoral directives.
    
4. **Budget proposals** are submitted to provincial committees for prioritization and approval before being forwarded to NESDC and MoF.
    

The “One Plan” concept emphasizes coherence across levels but lacks tools for **measuring resilience performance** or **tracking adaptation benefits**.

## **5. Fiscal and Capacity Realities**

- **Fiscal Dependence:** Over 70% of LGU budgets are from central transfers. This dependency limits their ability to plan multi-year or experimental adaptation projects.
    
- **Capacity Gaps:** Many small municipalities and SAOs lack technical expertise in risk assessment, data management, and adaptation planning.
    
- **Policy Opportunity:** Larger urban municipalities and PAOs can serve as **pilot sites** for CRI application and capacity development hubs.
    
- **Budget Leverage Points:** Integration of CRI results into **provincial budget prioritization** or **performance-based grants** can incentivize adoption.
    

## **6. Implications for CRI Design**

The existing multi-level structure offers both **institutional legitimacy** and **practical entry points** for the CRI. To leverage this system effectively, CRI design should:

1. **Embed within existing planning instruments** to avoid creating parallel processes.
    
2. **Align indicator structure with authority and data control**, focusing on variables LGUs can influence.
    
3. **Serve as a feedback tool** between local implementation and national monitoring.
    
4. **Be scalable and modular**, so that both PAOs and small municipalities can apply it with different levels of data sophistication.
    
5. **Incentivize adoption** by linking CRI use to capacity-building programs and budget allocation mechanisms.
