# Framing
Subiyanto et al. (2020) distinguish between these capacities based on the scope of adaptation—whether it maintains the current system or fundamentally alters it.

## Adaptive Capacity (Incremental Adaptation)

• **Definition:** Defined as **incremental adaptation**, actions aimed at maintaining the essence and integrity of a system or process at a given scale.

• **Measurement:** Quantified through indicators in three sectors:
- **Economy:** GDP ratio, Gini ratio, and the presence of small/medium industries.
- **Human Resources:** Human Development Index (HDI), workforce participation rate, and life satisfaction levels.
- **Infrastructure/Environment:** Environmental budget percentage, electricity access, road density, and safety equipment availability.

## Transformative Capacity (Transformational Adaptation)

• **Definition:** Defined as **transformational adaptation**, actions that change the fundamental attributes of a system. The paper categorizes this capacity into three spheres: _Practical_ (technological/behavioral), _Political_ (systems/structures), and _Personal_ (beliefs/worldviews).

• **Measurement:** Quantified using specific indicators for each sphere:
    ◦ **Practical:** Construction capabilities (e.g., containment dams, number of large construction companies).
    ◦ **Political:** Indonesian Democracy Index (IDI), women's parliamentary involvement, and the Corruption Perception Index (CPI).
    ◦ **Personal:** Technology adoption (cell phone and internet usage) and literacy habits (reading newspapers/books)

## 1. Core Definitions

- **Risk ($R$):** Defined within a Socio-Ecological System (SES) as $R = H \times E \times V$ (Hazard $\times$ Exposure $\times$ Vulnerability). This metric measures the probability of adverse consequences and is typically retrospective (_Quantifying Systemic Recovery: The Resilience Index Model_).
    
- **Intrinsic Resilience ($R_i$):** The system's inherent "toughness" or existing condition to withstand hazards, independent of specific future events. It is the positive counter-concept to vulnerability.
    
    - _Formula:_ $R_i = Sv \times AC$ (Survival $\times$ Adaptive Capacity).
        
    - _Source:_ _Defining the Metrics of Intrinsic Resilience_.
        
- **Climate Resilience Index ($RI$):** A dynamic metric operationally defined as the inverse of vulnerability, augmented by the capacity for transformation. It shifts the analytical focus from "potential loss" to "systemic recovery" (_Quantifying Systemic Recovery: The Resilience Index Model_).
    

#### 2. The Resilience Equation

The operational formula balances survival (maintenance) with long-term systemic change (_The Dual Calculus of Climate Resilience Indexing_):

$$RI = \frac{ACI \times TCI}{EI \times SI}$$

**Numerator (The Capacities):**

- **ACI (Adaptive Capacity Index) – "Coping":**
    
    - _Definition:_ Actions aimed at maintaining the essence and integrity of a system or process at a given scale (_Frameworks for Incremental and Transformative Adaptation Capacity_).
        
    - _Indicators:_
        - **Economy:** GDP ratio, Gini ratio, presence of small/medium industries.
        - **Human Resources:** HDI, workforce participation, life satisfaction.
        - **Infrastructure:** Road density, electricity access, environmental budget (_Frameworks for Incremental and Transformative Adaptation Capacity_).
            
- **TCI (Transformative Capacity Index) – "Changing":**
    - _Definition:_ Actions that change the fundamental attributes of a system to address future uncertainty (_The Calculus of Socio-Ecological Resilience_).
        
    - _Spheres of Transformation:_
        - **Practical:** Technological/behavioral (e.g., construction capabilities, dams).
        - **Political:** Systems/structures (e.g., Democracy Index, women's representation, Corruption Perception Index).
        - **Personal:** Beliefs/worldviews (e.g., literacy habits, technology adoption) (_Frameworks for Incremental and Transformative Adaptation Capacity_).
            

**Denominator (The Threats):**
- **EI (Exposure Index):** The presence of people, livelihoods, and assets in places that could be adversely affected (_The Climate Resilience Index Equation_).
- **SI (Sensitivity Index):** The internal condition indicating a system's susceptibility to interference (_The Climate Resilience Index Equation_).
    

#### 3. Calculation Methodology & Utility

- **Weighting:** Indices for ACI and TCI are computed using the **Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)** to derive weights for each indicator (_Frameworks for Incremental and Transformative Adaptation Capacity_).
    
- **Standardization:** Indicators are standardized on a scale of 1–5 (Very Low to Very High).
    
- **Operational Utility:**
    
    - **Risk Index:** Acts as a _diagnostic tool_ for **Step 1 (Assessment)** of the adaptation cycle to identify hotspots (_Quantifying Systemic Recovery: The Resilience Index Model_).
        
    - **Resilience Index:** Acts as a _monitoring tool_ for **Step 4 (MEL)** to measure the system's improved ability to reorganize and evolve (_Quantifying Systemic Recovery: The Resilience Index Model_).
