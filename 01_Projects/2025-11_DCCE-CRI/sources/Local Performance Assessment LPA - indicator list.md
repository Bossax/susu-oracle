key_findings: LPA has sets of indicators for 5 thematic areas which incentivize municipalities and PAO to align their actions to the criteria
---

LPA indicators are process, output, and outcome-based. However, the scoring criteria can be process-based (the means to achieve the outcome indicator targets oftentimes are prescriptive). It relies on self-reporting and checking-the-box exercise, which creates an issue about data quality.

>- SAO = Sub-district Administrative Organizations which could be municipalities of various sizes
>- PAO = Provincial Administrative Organization
>- LAO = Local Administrative Organization which includes SAOs and PAOs
