# what is Three-point estimation

Three-point estimation is a technique used primarily in project management and risk analysis to generate more accurate and reliable estimates for tasks such as time, cost, or resources by considering uncertainty and variability.[^1][^2][^6]

### Method Overview



Three-point estimation involves sourcing three different values for a project parameter:

- **Optimistic estimate (O)**: The best-case scenario where everything proceeds as planned with minimal issues.
- **Most likely estimate (M)**: The most probable outcome based on current circumstances and past experience.
- **Pessimistic estimate (P)**: The worst-case scenario where significant issues or delays occur.[^2][^5][^6]

These values are then used to compute an expected value and, if desired, a measure of uncertainty (standard deviation).[^4][^6][^1]

### Calculation Formulas

Two major statistical methods are used with these values:[^2][^4]

- **Triangular Distribution**: Gives equal weight to each estimate.

$$
E = \frac{O + M + P}{3}
$$
- **Beta Distribution (PERT)**: Weighs the most likely estimate more strongly.

$$
E = \frac{O + 4M + P}{6}
$$

Standard deviation for PERT:

$$
SD = \frac{P - O}{6}
$$


### Application and Benefits

- Enhances estimation accuracy by recognizing uncertainty and possible risk scenarios.[^6][^1]
- Widely used for project scheduling, budgeting, and risk analysis—especially with techniques like PERT (Program Evaluation Review Technique) and Monte Carlo simulation.[^4][^6]
- Helps project teams plan realistically and manage expectations by anticipating a range of outcomes.

This approach is particularly valuable when only limited historical data is available and when risks of under- or overestimation can have significant project consequences.[^1][^6]
