>[!note] Change log
> v1: Created based on Kick-off meeting and Workplan Discussion (15 Dec 2025)

This implementation plan translates the Terms of Reference (TOR) and the workplan discussion into a coherent technical roadmap. It emphasizes institutional alignment, governance clarification, and strategic planning rather than software development. The goal is to create a "Targeted NFCS" that connects the Thai Meteorological Department (TMD) with the urban sector's climate information needs.

# Strategic Alignment with Urban-Act 

To ensure efficiency and alignment with the broader **"Integrated Urban Climate, Weather, and Environment Systems for Climate-smart and Resilient Cities (IUC4CRC)"** initiative, this project adopts a specific "Governance & Service" focus:

| Feature     | **Urban-Act  (Broader Context)**                                                | **TMD-WMO NFCS (This Project)**                                                     |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Role**    | **The User & Beneficiary**                                                      | **The Service Provider & Enabler**                                                  |
| **Scope**   | Broad urban resilience implementation, green infrastructure, and city planning. | Specific **governance framework** to regularize the flow of climate data to cities. |
| **Output**  | Resilient urban designs and policy integration.                                 | **Strategic Roadmap & Costed Action Plan** for institutionalizing climate services. |
| **Synergy** | Creates the demand for climate data.                                            | Establishes the **User Interface Platform (UIP)** to supply that data effectively.  |

# Key Project Deliverables and Strategic Framing

### 1. Targeted NFCS Governance Framework
This framework serves as the **Institutional Layer** of the project. It maps the mandates, roles, and responsibilities required to deliver climate services effectively.
- **Business Artifact (The Governance Analysis):** An analysis of how current laws (e.g., Climate Change Act, DRR plans) and policies position TMD relative to other agencies .
- **Governance Arrangement:** A validated structure (e.g., Steering Committee, Task Force) that clarifies the "Climate Services Value Chain" between TMD (provider) and Urban/Security agencies (users) like DPT, DDPM, and BMA.

### 2. Baseline Assessment of Urban Climate Services
The **Baseline Assessment** establishes the current "Supply vs. Demand" status for climate information in the human settlement sector.
- **Stakeholder Matrix:** A classified map of the ecosystem, identifying Data Providers (TMD), Co-producers, Users (Local Gov), Boundary Organizations (Media/NGOs), and Enablers.
- **Capacity Gap Report:** A diagnostic report derived from WMO-standard surveys adapted for Thailand. It identifies existing services, technical capacities, and critical gaps in meeting the needs of urban planners and security agencies 594].

### 3. Strategic Roadmap and Costed Action Plan
The core strategic output is a forward-looking **Action Plan** that operationalizes the NFCS.
- **Strategic Vision:** A set of goals and objectives aligned with national development plans.
- **Costed Implementation Matrix:** A detailed plan specifying strategies, priority actions (e.g., new observation stations, data sharing protocols), responsible entities, timelines, and estimated costs.
- **Task Force Mechanism:** The establishment of a "Human Settlement & Security Sector Task Force" to ensure ownership and sustainability of the plan beyond the project lifecycle.

# Work Packages and Activities

The project is organized into three main phases (Tasks) that function as Work Packages (WPs).

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                     | Potential Impact                                                                       | Mitigation                                                                                                                                              |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Survey Fatigue**       | Low response rate to the baseline assessment questionnaire.                            | **Contextualization:** Adapt WMO questions to be concise and relevant to Thai stakeholders. Use focus groups for key VIPs instead of just online forms. |
| **Mandate Ambiguity**    | Agencies (DPT, DDPM) may not agree on TMD’s role or the proposed governance structure. | **Co-design:** Involve these agencies early in the "Task Force" (WP3) so they co-author the roadmap rather than just reviewing it                       |
| **Timing Constraints**   | Short window (Feb) for data collection may delay the March workshop.                   | **Prioritization:** Prioritize the "Key Stakeholder List" early in January to ensure the survey launches immediately in Feb                             |
| **Political Transition** | Changes in agency leadership could stall endorsement.                                  | **Institutional Focus:** Anchor the roadmap in existing long-term plans (NAP, Climate Act) to ensure continuity regardless of personnel changes.        |
