>[!note] Change Log
>15 Dec 2025: confirmation of work plan with TMD


**1. Current project health & priority** The project is **Green** but schedule pressure is increasing due to the confirmed workshop date (Mar 9-13). The immediate priority is finalizing the **Policy & Mandate Review** and the **Stakeholder Map** (with strict attendee criteria) in January to ensure the February data collection runs smoothly .

**2. Near‑term focus (next 2–4 weeks)**

1. **Policy Review:** Analyze the **Climate Change Act**, TMD Act, and  TMD’s **5-Year Master Plan** to understand legal mandates.
    
2. **Stakeholder Criteria:** Draft specific requirements for workshop representatives to avoid "tokenism" (wrong participants).
    
3. **Task Force Synergy:** Meet with the **Urban Act** project team to discuss piggybacking on their Task Force structure.
    
4. **Progress Meeting #1:** Prepare findings for the **Jan 2026** meeting (Stakeholders + KII Plan).
    
5. **Budget Analysis:** Begin assessing how "Climate Services" can be framed as "Technical Capacity" to ensure future government funding.
    

**3. Key decisions & assumptions to remember**

- **Workshop Date:** Fixed for **9–13 March 2026**; Baseline Report draft is required _before_ this date.
    
- **Task Force:** We assume we can leverage the **Urban Act Task Force** rather than creating a new body from scratch.
    
- **Budgeting:** "Climate Services" may not qualify for "Digital Infrastructure" budget; we must frame them as "Capacity Development".
    
- **Strategy Status:** TMD currently lacks a proactive Climate Strategy; this project must fill that gap.
    

**4. Imminent milestones & deadlines**

- **Jan 2026:** Progress Meeting #1 (Stakeholder Map & KII Plan).
    
- **Feb 2026:** Launch of KIIs and Questionnaire.
    
- **Early Mar 2026:** Draft Baseline Assessment Report complete (Internal Deadline).
    
- **9–13 Mar 2026:** Consultation Workshop #1.
    

**5. Short‑term risks & watchpoints**

- **Tokenism:** Risk of agencies sending non-technical staff if we don't set strict attendee criteria.
    
- **Budget Eligibility:** Risk that the final Action Plan is unfundable if not aligned with Ministry of Digital Economy's "Infrastructure" definitions.
    
- **Access:** Need timely access to TMD’s internal **5-Year Master Plan** and Urban Act outputs.
    

**6. Next sponsor/steering message**

- **Milestone:** Workshop date confirmed for **Mar 9–13**; we are accelerating the reporting timeline to match.
    
- **Strategy:** We are exploring synergy with the **Urban Act Task Force** to streamline governance.
    
- **Request:** We need access to the **TMD 5-Year Master Plan** and **Urban Act outputs** to align our strategic roadmap.
    
- **Action:** We are drafting strict **participant criteria** for the workshop to ensure meaningful engagement.
