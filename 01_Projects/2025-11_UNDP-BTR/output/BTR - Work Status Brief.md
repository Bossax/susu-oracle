**1. Current project health & priority** 

 >[!caution] 
 >A critical strategic divergence has emerged: the Adaptation M&E Platform will now be designed based on **TDRI's NAP Action Plan outputs** (action-oriented/bottom-up) rather than a pure M&E theoretical framework. Our priority is to rapidly assess the gap between these NAP indicators and the A-BTR's outcome-reporting requirements to ensure we can still produce a compliant Baseline Chapter.

The priorities are
1. ADPC refining the hazard and exposure dataset lists for the **Feb 11 Consultation Workshop**
2.  Creagy adopting the **NAP action plan’s indicator list** to begin mapping baseline data availability.
3. Bridge the "Two-Track" M&E approach: accepting the CU Research Team's "Standard Output Indicators" for agency monitoring 
4. Develop a translation logic to convert these into the outcome-level data required for the BTR.
5. **Refine Baseline Logic:** Document the theoretical distinction between Physical, Socio-Economic, and Evaluative baselines for the framework.
6. **Dataset Finalization:** Support ADPC in finalizing the hazard/exposure list for the Feb 11 Workshop.
7. **Workshop Prep:** Finalize agenda/invitations for the **Feb 11 Consultation Workshop** (Supply-side data owners).

**2. Near‑term focus (next 2–4 weeks)**
1. **Dataset Iteration:** ADPC to update the hazard/exposure list based on recent feedback. Support ADPC in finalizing the hazard/exposure list for the Feb 11 Consultation Workshop.
2. **Analyze TDRI Inputs:** Review `[[Analysis of NAP Indicators and Adaptation M&E Contribution]]` to understand the new data structure of the platform. 
3. **Gap Analysis:** Determine if the NAP "Action" indicators can mathematically or logically serve as proxies for BTR "Resilience/Impact" outcomes. 
4. **Bridge Strategy:** Refine the "Translation Matrix" to map the likely stakeholder-derived NAP metrics to the CU Manual's theoretical risk categories (Exposure/Sensitivity/Resilience). 
5. **Refine Baseline Logic:** Document the theoretical distinction between Physical, Socio-Economic, and Evaluative baselines for the framework.
6. **Workshop Prep:** Finalize agenda/invitations for the **Feb 11 Consultation Workshop** (Supply-side data owners).
7. **Workflow Update:** Instruct Tonklar to shift research focus from "Theoretical M&E" to "NAP Action Indicator Availability."
8. **Climate IVRA and L&D literature review strategy:** Finalize the strategic plan for the Climate Change Impact and L&D literature review (execution deferred to post-Feb)
    

**3. Key decisions & assumptions to remember**

- **Creagy’s Role:** We are responsible for establishing "baseline values" for these adopted indicators, specifically focusing on impact and outcome levels.
* **The TDRI Pivot:** The M&E Platform database tables will change to match the NAP Action Plan, not the previously assumed CU Manual structure. 
* **Methodological Risk:** Indicators are likely stakeholder-derived and may lack MEL theoretical rigor (e.g., confusing outputs with outcomes). 
*  **BTR Independence:** We cannot rely solely on the Platform's automatic outputs for the A-BTR; we must build a "Translation Layer" or calculate baselines manually if the platform data is too granular. 
*  **Feb 11 Workshop:** Still on track; focuses on physical hazard data (official sources), which is immune to the NAP indicator changes. 
*  **Two-Track remains:** We still accept the "Platform/NAP" data (Track 1) but must rigorously translate it for "Evaluation" (Track 2).
- **Tonklar’s Role:** Tonklar is assigned to review the adaptation M&E indicators; I must provide the workflow.
- **Timeline Shift:** The L&D literature review is deprioritized until after the February deliverable submission.



    

**4. Imminent milestones & deadlines**

- **Jan 2026:** Revised Candidate Dataset List (ADPC).
- **11 Feb 2026:** ADPC Consultation Workshop (Data Owners).
- **Mar 2026:** CU Research Team completes "e-form" design (critical alignment point).
- **May 2026:** Advantage Consulting submits final M&E pilot report.
    

**5. Short‑term risks & watchpoints**
* **Incompatibility:** The "NAP Action" data may be purely administrative (e.g., "Number of meetings") and unusable for assessing climate resilience improvement. 
* **Definition Chaos:** Stakeholders may have defined indicators loosely; we may need to retroactively apply strict definitions for the BTR. 
* **Platform Usability:** There is no guarantee the platform outputs will be ready or relevant for the A-BTR reporting timeline.
- **Data Aggregability:** Uncertainty remains on whether data in the proposed tables can be aggregated to produce UAE GGA metrics.
- **Data Availability:** Specific "Sectoral Resilience" indicators defined by CU may not have existing official data, complicating baseline calculation.
- **List Delay:** ADPC must refine the dataset list quickly to ensure the Feb 11 workshop has a concrete proposal.
    

**6. Next sponsor/steering message**

* **Alert:** The M&E Platform design is shifting to align with TDRI's NAP Action Plan. 
* **Implication:** This pushes the system toward "Activity Monitoring" (Track 1) rather than "Impact Evaluation." 
* **Solution:** We are developing a "Translation Matrix" to convert these NAP actions into the resilience outcomes required for the BTR. 
*  **Progress:** Hazard data preparation for the Feb 11 workshop is unaffected and proceeding on schedule. 
*  **Ask:** We need access to the latest TDRI indicator lists immediately to finalize our baseline approach.
