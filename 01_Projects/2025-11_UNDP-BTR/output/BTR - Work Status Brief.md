**1. Current project health & priority** 

 >[!caution] 
 >**Strategic Divergence Managed:** We are adapting to the fact that the M&E Platform is built on TDRI's NAP Action Plan (Activity-based). Our priority is bridging this to the BTR's Outcome-based reporting via a **Translation Matrix**.

The priorities are:
1.  **Feb 11 Workshop (Critical):** Finalize the "Official" Hazard/Exposure dataset list with ADPC for validation by data owners.
2.  **M&E Translation:** Map the TDRI NAP indicators (Activity) to BTR Resilience/Impact categories (Outcome).
3.  **Baseline Definition:** Explicitly define Physical vs. Socio-Economic vs. Evaluative baselines to clarify the "Baseline Chapter" structure.
4.  **Stakeholder Engagement:** Prepare the agenda and invitations for the Feb 11 Consultation.

**2. Near‑term focus (next 2–4 weeks)**
1.  **Feb 11 Workshop Execution:** Ensure the ADPC dataset list is solid and presented clearly to agencies (GISTDA, DDPM, etc.).
2.  **NAP Indicator Analysis:** Deep dive into the TDRI indicator list to identify which ones can serve as valid proxies for resilience outcomes.
3.  **Draft Translation Matrix:** Create the logic map: "If NAP tracks X meetings (Activity), we report Y institutional readiness (Outcome)."
4.  **Tonklar's Workflow:** Direct Tonklar to focus on data availability for the *mapped* indicators, not theoretical ones.
5.  **Baseline Chapter Outline:** Draft the skeletal structure of the Baseline Chapter based on the "Three Baseline Types" concept.

**3. Key decisions & assumptions to remember**

-   **Two-Track System:** We accept the NAP/Platform data (Track 1 - Activity) but must build a separate "Evaluative Layer" (Track 2 - Outcome) for the BTR.
-   **Feb 11 is "Physical":** The workshop focuses on Hazard/Exposure data (Physical Baseline), which is stable. The M&E (Evaluative) chaos does not affect this event.
-   **Manual Calculation:** We assume we will need to manually calculate the "Resilience" baselines, as the Platform's auto-generated reports may be too granular or activity-focused.
-   **TDRI Alignment:** We will not fight the TDRI framework; we will "wrapper" it with our BTR reporting logic.

**4. Imminent milestones & deadlines**

-   **11 Feb 2026:** ADPC Consultation Workshop (Data Owners - Critical).
-   **28 Feb 2026:** Submit Batch Deliverable (Draft Baseline Framework / DRS).
-   **Mar 2026:** CU Research Team completes "e-form" design.

**5. Short‑term risks & watchpoints**
-   **Data "Black Box":** If ADPC fails to secure the "Official" datasets at the Feb 11 meeting, our Physical Baseline is at risk.
-   **Proxy Failure:** The NAP "Action" indicators might be too weak to serve as proxies for actual resilience (e.g., "Plan exists" does not mean "Risk reduced").
-   **Stakeholder Fatigue:** Agencies might be confused by the multiple M&E frameworks (NAP vs. BTR vs. CGE).

**6. Next sponsor/steering message**

-   **Feb 11 Ready:** We are fully prepared for the Data Consultation Workshop. The dataset list is finalized for validation.
-   **M&E Solution:** We are handling the "NAP vs. BTR" divergence by creating a **Translation Matrix**. We will report on NAP actions but interpret them through the lens of BTR resilience outcomes.
-   **Baseline Progress:** We are distinguishing between "Physical Risk Baselines" (from ADPC data) and "Adaptation Performance Baselines" (from NAP data) to ensure clarity in the final report.
