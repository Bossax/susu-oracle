“Today, more countries have integrated MEL systems as part of their national adaptation plans (NAPs), processes, and actions. The uptake has been slow, but significant progress has been observed since 2014.” (IISD, p. iii) a decade long history of national adaptation MEL

“MEL systems are needed across scales, especially at the national level, to understand the impacts and effectiveness of adaptation actions.” (IISD, p. iii) why MEL is needed

“Global Climate Resilience” (IISD, p. iii)

“Among these countries, the operationalization of MEL systems focuses primarily on monitoring and progress reporting, while evaluation and learning remain less developed” (IISD, p. iii)

“Some countries, such as France, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam, have more advanced MEL systems, where the focus has turned to evaluation and learning” (IISD, p. iii)

“This research further shows that establishing a MEL system is generally an incremental process in which components are added over time, taking into account the country’s circumstances, capacities, adaptation needs, and goals.” (IISD, p. iii)

“In fact, work in this area has grown significantly in recent years. As of 2024, 53% of countries that have submitted their national adaptation plan (NAP) documents have included MEL frameworks” (IISD, p. 1) Thailand has done this too but in a very superficial way

“The global goal on adaptation (GGA) established in Article 7 of the Paris Agreement in 2015, the GlasgowSharm el-Sheikh Work Programme on the GGA, and the 2023 United Arab Emirates (UAE) Framework for Global Climate Resilience (FGCR) have reinforced the need to monitor, report, assess, and learn from collective adaptation progress across local, national, and international levels” (IISD, p. 1)

“how national MEL systems for adaptation can inform global reporting adaptation processes, such as the UAE FGCR.” (IISD, p. 2)

(IISD, p. 2) - discuss 5 main components of MEL  
- case studies of the 5 components  
- compare with 2014 study to present the development  
  
- recommendations to align with UAE FGCR for state and non-state actors

# Definitions

“The overarching aim of MEL systems is to inform policies and practices from the data and evidence generated by the iterative process of tracking, assessing, and learning throughout the national adaptation plan (NAP) and other adaptation planning processes” (IISD, p. 4)

“Monitoring is the systematic tracking of implementation and performance that helps countries to understand if progress is being made and identify problems.” (IISD, p. 4) Progress: how is it implemented and how is it performing?

“Evaluations use both monitoring data and information from additional sources, such as research results and external evidence, to determine the performance or success of implementation of adaptation policies, plans, and processes, per their stated goals.” (IISD, p. 4) can be implemented at various scales whether it is policy, NAP process, program, project, initiative

“Learning in the context of MEL for adaptation is defined as the collective and deliberate process of acquiring, assessing, and disseminating new knowledge that results in changed or reinforced knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours related to climate change adaptation” (IISD, p. 4)

“A MEL system for adaptation includes tools, responsibilities, and processes that support data collection, analysis, and the integration of findings into adaptation practices and decision making” (IISD, p. 5) include decision-making space (similar to CRM)

“Unlike traditional M&E, MEL systems incorporate feedback mechanisms to identify necessary improvements and drive changes in tracking systems (Beauchamp et al., 2024)” (IISD, p. 5)

==Decision-making space==

(IISD, p. 5) 
# Components of MEL system  
In line with NAP Global Network's work  

1. context of the MEL system  
	- Status: what are in place (like adaptation specific processes, institutions and tools)  
	- Purpose: goal of the MEL system  
	- Enabling factors: context of the relevant systems  
2. approaches used to plan, develop and implement the MEL system  
	- IVRA: how does the MEL system make use of IVRAs?  
	- Targets of multiple plans: what are the targets and indicators that other plans have set?  
	- Methods and tools (data system): how is it designed and operated?

> [!quote] impact, vulnerability, and risk assessments = IVRA

3. Monitoring component  
4. Evaluation component  
	- activities  
	- processes  
	- outputs  
5. Learning component  
	- how does the information generated through M&E processes enter the decision making space?

>UAE #FGCR will be central to the assessment of global progress toward the GGA (adopted in 2023)

“By the end of 2024, countries are expected to submit Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs), so it is critically important that they have systems to track adaptation effectively” (IISD, p. 10)


(IISD, p. 10)

“by 2030, all countries will have “designed, established and operationalized a system for monitoring, evaluation and learning for their national adaptation efforts and have built the required institutional capacity to fully implement the system” (IISD, p. 10)

**UK**
“In this first report, the Adaptation Sub-Committee of the Climate Change Committee (CCC) used a “preparedness ladder” to systematically assess adaptation efforts and provide recommendations for further action” (IISD, p. 14) *Early framework*

“the CCC shifted to more detailed frameworks referred to as “monitoring maps.”” (IISD, p. 14) *later framework*

“Somalia and Namibia, where discussions about establishing a MEL system for adaptation started in 2018 and 2019, respectively, in tandem with the commencement of their NAP processes.” (IISD, p. 14) *Similar progress timeline as Thailand*

“Ministry of Planning, Investment, and Economic Development has been using an integrated framework to track development projects across the country.” (IISD, p. 14)

“In Namibia, the 5-year national development plan outlines priority actions and indicators, some of which are relevant for adaptation.” (IISD, p. 14) 
=> ==check== national strategy and NESD plan to find relevant indicators

“For instance, in line with the Pan-Canadian Framework on Green Growth and Climate Change, the Government of Canada has been publishing annual reports that also highlight adaptation progress. However, efforts to establish a MEL system were only formally established with the adoption of the National Adaptation Strategy (NAS) in 2023” (IISD, p. 15)

(IISD, p. 15) 

>[!Info] 
>Thailand has started reporting mitigation efforts since xxxx. Adaptation progress reporting was first initiated in 2024 as part of A-BTR reporting. The reporting framework is rather ad-hoc.


“It is important to consider subnational MEL systems, given their potential to capture local adaptation experiences.” (IISD, p. 15)

“in Vietnam and Kenya, the ministries responsible for agriculture have established MEL systems for tracking adaptation efforts within the sector.” (IISD, p. 15)


**Phased approach**
“Peru has also strategically adopted a stepwise approach comprising four phases: design, which was completed in 2021 with the establishment of indicators and platforms; analysis, through which logical and physical elements are being put in place; development (programming, software creation, and capacity building); and implementation.” (IISD, p. 15) how does the adaptation MEL system roll-out plan sync with national climate service system?

# Scope of MEL systems

“the use of the MEL system to track progress in implementing adaptation plans and programs” (IISD, p. 16) ==by the state actors?==

“Other countries aim to assess the overall progress of implementing adaptation actions, thus taking a whole-of-society approach that acknowledges the contribution and role of state and non-state actors.” (IISD, p. 16) overall progress - stock take every action

“For instance, in Kenya, government ministries and departments, the private sector, and civil society are mandated to report on their adaptation efforts and results.” (IISD, p. 16) legally required to report adaptation?

# Legal instruments
“France, Kenya, Namibia, Peru, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam have additional policy instruments that articulate the mandates for various actors in the MEL system.” (IISD, p. 16)

“For example, Articles 15(5) and 19 of Kenya’s Climate Change Act 2016 articulate mandates for ministries, departments, and government agencies at national and sub-national levels to report on their efforts annually (Republic of Kenya, 2016b)” (IISD, p. 17)

“Kenya’s Ministry of Environment, Climate Change and Forestry has established tools and processes to capture the adaptation efforts of various actors across the country, albeit with slow progress” (IISD, p. 17)

# Institutional arrangement 
“often mandating a nodal ministry or government agency to guide that work and perhaps also mandating participation from other government entities to provide data for MEL processes.” (IISD, p. 17) laws and policies are indispensable

“All the sampled countries have designated an administrative unit within the government to coordinate adaptation activities and MEL within the country.” (IISD, p. 17) division of monitoring and evaluation?

>[!info]
> In Thailand, Adaptation MEL group under the Adaptation Division must lead the development of the MEL system

(IISD, p. 18) Having only reporting mandate at the ministerial focal point level has been proven to produce low integration of sub national authorities and non-governmental actors. *Legislation could enhance this with additional burden*

“Peru’s participatory process involves sub-national governments and Indigenous populations, and Vietnam’s feedback mechanisms involve various ministries and subnational entities.” (IISD, p. 18)

“Some countries are integrating the financing of their MEL system into their national budgets and government structures, which increases their sustainability and effectiveness.” (IISD, p. 18)

“Vietnam’s MEL system for adaptation is supported by dedicated staff and resources within the Department of Climate Change, indicating a strong commitment to integrating MEL financing within government operations” (IISD, p. 18)

“dependency often impacts the sustainability and continuity of MEL activities. In these countries, a common approach to bridge the gap is to use external support through donor-funded projects and outsourcing services to prepare progress reports.” (IISD, p. 19)

“In most countries, the MEL system is designed to monitor progress in implementing prioritized adaptation actions and predefined targets, which are presumed to correspond to the risks identified in the IVRA. Notable exceptions are the United Kingdom, Canada, and Vietnam, which explicitly articulate a logical framework that establishes these linkages.” (IISD, p. 22) log frames can make the linkages between actions at multiple levels and the results  of IVRA **explicit**

“Both Kenya’s NCCAP III and the United Kingdom’s National Adaptation Programme use Theories of Change to link the plans and/or IVRAs with components of their MEL system. Kenya uses a Theory of Change to develop indicators on the basis of the NAP’s macro-level adaptation actions and the adaptation vision, while the United Kingdom’s monitoring maps articulate the contextual priority actions and plans, enablers, desired outcomes, and overarching adaptation goal.” (IISD, p. 23) Do we have a logical linkage that connects IVRA, actions, and MEL system?

“The list includes a mix of qualitative and quantitative indicators, as well as process and outcome indicators.” (IISD, p. 23) NAP implementation indicators can be outcome and process indicators

“Monitoring is essential for taking stock of adaptation efforts undertaken by various actors and their immediate results.” (IISD, p. 27)

“in most cases, the production of the monitoring reports is contingent upon the availability of resources, indicating the challenge for countries to continuously monitor adaptation.” (IISD, p. 27)

“In France, the CNTE publishes annual reviews of progress on NAP implementation and publishes opinions with recommendations for the next steps. The reports are based on data from ministerial focal points.” (IISD, p. 27)

“evaluation is based on the direction of change in the various results indicators in the context of trends in climate vulnerabilities. Each thematic area is assessed based on whether the necessary adaptation policies have been adopted and the implementation status of priority actions.” (IISD, p. 27) Evaluation can be focused on the changes in the indicators

“Kenya and France take a different approach, linking progress reports and evaluations to assess the performance of programs and investments with their NAP’s stated objectives.” (IISD, p. 28) Evaluation can benchmark the program performance against stated objectives

“In France, once evaluation reports are published, the government organizes environmental conferences where stakeholders discuss the recommendations and chart the best course of action.” (IISD, p. 30)

“Data collection methods can be designed to not only take stock of actions that are linked to NAPs but also to capture the efforts of other actors who may not have a formal mandate to implement NAPs” (IISD, p. 35)

“MEL systems need to assess the outcomes and impacts of adaptation efforts.” (IISD, p. 35)

“It is therefore more impactful if countries focus on national progress reporting as opposed to tracking adaptation solely to meet international reporting obligations” (IISD, p. 35)

“Even though countries like Namibia and Somalia lack extensive MEL systems, they have other tracking and reporting mechanisms for sustainable development that could be built on to establish MEL systems for adaptation” (IISD, p. 36)

“Evaluations help identify gaps in the performance of adaptation actions and highlight areas for improvement where indicators cannot” (IISD, p. 36)

“France, Kenya, and the United Kingdom’s use of evaluations and progress reports to feed back into the next cycles of adaptation plans” (IISD, p. 37)
