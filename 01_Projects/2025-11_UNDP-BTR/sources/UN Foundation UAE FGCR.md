Adopted in December 2023 at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 28) in Dubai, it is the first international declaration of its kind with climate adaptation as the primary focus.

# What is the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience?

The framework is the ==culmination of two years of workshops and consultations with hundreds of government officials, scientists, and advocates==. It expands on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA), which was established in the Paris Agreement in 2015. The UAE Framework will improve our ability to measure progress on the GGA and maintain accountability. More broadly, the framework’s adoption signals the need for accelerating global action on, and support for, adaptation — which until now has not received the same level of funding or attention as other aspects of the Paris Agreement.

While the framework does not establish a headline target akin to the Paris Agreement’s global warming threshold of staying within 1.5° C above preindustrial temperatures, it does place focus squarely on the “collective well-being of all people, the protection of livelihoods and economies, and the preservation and regeneration of nature, for current and future generations, in the context of the temperature goal.” In other words, the well-being of people and the planet serves as the framework’s guiding star. It also prioritizes key sectors for increased climate resilience, including food and agriculture, water, cities and infrastructure, ecosystems and nature, health, livelihoods, and cultural heritage, sending an important message to practitioners in these sectors that urgent action on climate adaptation will be necessary for humanity to survive.

In addition, the framework details a series of targets linked to different stages of the country-level policy cycle required to achieve these adaptation goals. It lays out clear and concrete steps that start with government-led assessments of each nation’s unique climate risks and vulnerabilities, which will inform the creation of a national adaptation plan, followed by implementation and ongoing evaluation of progress in reducing climate vulnerability.

# Next Steps for the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience

1. **Measuring progress toward the Global Goal on Adaptation**: The framework establishes a two-year UAE–Belém work program – so named for the host cities of COP28 and COP30 – to develop more specific and standardized indicators for measuring progress toward the targets it outlines. It will be essential for the new Dubai action plan to build upon already existing agendas like the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), the [Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction](https://www.undrr.org/implementing-sendai-framework/what-sendai-framework#:~:text=The%20Sendai%20Framework%20focuses%20on,existing%20risk%20and%20increase%20resilience.), and other multilateral agreements that have relevant indicators. This process will need to incorporate the expertise of scientists, researchers, and practitioners across the globe to ensure that we are measuring what matters and not just what is easiest to measure.

2. **Financing critical adaptation needs**: While the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience marks a crucial step forward, the international community must also find innovative and creative ways to mobilize financial resources, especially for developing economies, to realize the promise of the Global Goal on Adaptation. These investments must be both larger and more flexible than current financing if low-income nations are to meet the level of ambition on climate adaptation outlined in the new framework.

## Technical Papers

#### Linkages Between the New Collective Quantified Goal and the Global Goal on Adaptation

Produced by C2ES and the United Nations Foundation, this paper evaluates the existing language promoting NCQG-GGA linkage and potential indicators for progress — and how the NCQG can facilitate a better prioritization of adaptation finance. (October 2024)

#### Transformational Adaptation for COP29

Transformational adaptation is an evolving concept within climate adaptation and resilience literature, emphasizing systemic shifts that address root causes of vulnerability while considering the spatial scale of changes. Key features include durable interventions and the potential for broader systemic transformations, though definitions vary. The upcoming sixth meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA6) in November 2024 will be a crucial platform for clarifying this concept across sectors and scales, showcasing implementation examples, and discussing assessment methods for transformative strategies. This paper examines options for defining transformational adaptation within the UNFCCC context, building on outcomes from COP28 as Parties prepare for CMA6. (September 2024)

#### Options for a PolitIcally-Salient Headline for the Global Goal on Adaptation

The outcome of the Paris Agreement established the Global Goal on Adaptation, not as a quantitative goal but as a shared aspiration. Several different formulations for an overarching goal have been proposed formally and informally through the Glasgow Sharm el-Sheikh work program and related discussions. In this brief, co-authored by the UN Foundation’s Cristina Rumbaitis del Rio and Kaveh Guilanpour from C2ES, some of these proposals are explored while highlighting their benefits, drawbacks, and considerations.

#### Compilation of Illustrative Targets and Indicators for the Global Goal on Adaptation

One of the objectives of the Glasgow Sharm el-Sheikh work program is to enhance understanding of the Global Goal on Adaptation, including of the methodologies, indicators, data and metrics, needs and support needed for assessing progress towards it. This submission includes a compilation of indicative targets and indicators from selected existing international agreements that can be used to support this process. (May 2023)
