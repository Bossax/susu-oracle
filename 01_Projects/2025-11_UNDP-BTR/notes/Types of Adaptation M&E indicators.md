# Impact-based indicator
An **impact-based indicator** measures the **long-term societal, economic, or environmental consequences** resulting from a development intervention. These indicators are used to assess the effectiveness of adaptation actions and their contribution to enhancing adaptive capacity.

Key characteristics of impact-based indicators:

- They capture **positive and negative long-term effects** on identifiable population groups. [^1]
- They are positioned at the **end of the results chain**, assessing effects that may not be directly or solely attributable to a specific project due to various influences.[^1]
- Measuring data for impact indicators often requires **extensive and costly surveys** or the use of existing national data sources like censuses.[^2]

Examples of impact-based indicators include:

1. **Total number of direct and indirect beneficiaries** from adaptation projects. (AF Fund's level)
2. **Tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2eq) reduced or avoided** for mitigation efforts. (AF Fund's level)
3. Changes in **expected losses of lives, value of physical assets, livelihoods, and/or environmental or social losses** due to climate-related impacts. (GCF Fund's level)
4. **Increased income or avoided decrease in income** for targeted beneficiaries.  (AF Fund's level)
5. **Natural assets protected or rehabilitated**.  (AF Fund's level)
6. The **value of physical assets made more resilient** or capable of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. (GCF Fund's level)
7. **Hectares of natural resource areas** under improved low-emission or climate-resilient management practices.
8. Measures of **economic benefits (Saved Wealth)** and **health benefits (Saved Health)**, such as disability-adjusted life years saved or avoided mortality. [^1]

Challenges exist in developing and applying impact-based indicators due to their context-specific nature and the difficulty in isolating the precise contribution of a single intervention to long-term changes. Consistency in measurement and aggregation across projects or institutions remains a challenge.


# Outcome-based indicators
**Outcome-based indicators** measure the **intended or achieved short-to-medium-term effects of an intervention’s outputs**. They represent **changes in development conditions** that occur between the completion of outputs and the achievement of impact. An outcome statement describes **longer-term and specific changes in conditions, policies, or organizational structure** that are typically measured a year or several years after project completion. These indicators capture what is being achieved. Data for outcomes are often gathered through consultations with beneficiaries, surveys, or rapid appraisal methods.

Examples of outcome-based indicators include:
- Changes in resilience, adaptive capacity, or reductions in vulnerability.
- Increased income or avoided decrease in income for targeted beneficiaries.
- Changes in the prevalence and incidence of climate-sensitive health outcomes.
- The number of people with reduced risk to extreme weather events.
- The percentage of households and communities with more secure access to livelihood assets.
- The extent of the adoption of or level of access to climate-resilient practices.
- Increased agricultural productivity (yields) due to adaptation measures.
# Output-based indicators
**Output-based indicators** measure the **products and services delivered** as a direct result of activities within a development intervention. An output statement highlights what a project or program intends to achieve in the **short-term**, or what it intends to produce to achieve its outcomes. These indicators provide useful information on activities and achievements that affect outcomes and are often generated by project staff.

Examples of output-based indicators include:

- The number and type of projects that conduct and update risk and vulnerability assessments.
- The development of early warning systems.
- The number of staff trained to respond to and mitigate climate-related impacts.
- The number of physical assets strengthened, constructed, or moved to withstand climate variability.
- The number and type of adaptation assets created to support livelihoods, such as microfinance programs or savings systems.
- The number of plans developed and/or implemented with climate change mainstreamed.
- The frequency of dissemination of updated dynamic agricultural calendars and climate information.

**Scales of Relevance:**
- Output-based and outcome-based indicators are commonly applied at the **project and program levels** to track implementation progress and achievement of results. They inform project management and learning, and serve accountability purposes.
- These indicators can also be part of **national-level monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems**, reflecting national and sectoral priorities. While localized indicators are crucial for relevance at the local level, efforts are made to link them to national and potentially global frameworks.
- For **portfolio-level aggregation**, simplified or standardized indicators, such as the "number of beneficiaries," are sometimes used, though this may limit the richness of adaptation outcomes. The aim is often to capture quantifiable climate results across diverse projects.
- There is a recognition that metrics appropriate for project or local levels may not be suitable for national or international aggregation. Different purposes of M&E (e.g., adaptive management, accountability, learning) may require different methods and metrics.
