## Context and Sources

Thailand’s first A‑BTR (dated August 2024) contains an executive summary that broadly follows Chapter IV of the ETF modalities, procedures and guidelines (MPGs). To evaluate it, I compared the contents of the PDF document “Adaptation Section of the Biennial Transparency Report” with two research summaries: (1) _DP – Adaptation Reporting in the Biennial Transparency Report for Developing Nations_ and (2) _Adaptation Chapter of BTR – guiding principles_. These reference documents provide best‑practice guidance and highlight common pitfalls that developing countries face when preparing adaptation chapters.

The first A‑BTR consists of eight subsections: 
1. national circumstances and institutional frameworks
2. impacts/risks/vulnerabilities
3. adaptation priorities and barriers
4. adaptation strategies (policy and planning), progress on implementation
5. monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
6. information on loss and damage (L&D)
7. cooperation/good practices. 

It is intended as both an executive summary and a progress report on Thailand’s adaptation efforts.

## Alignment with ETF Guidelines

### Positive elements

- **Structured around the MPG sections.** The first A‑BTR covers the recommended subsections for adaptation. Section 1.1 discusses national circumstances and institutional arrangements, noting that Thailand ranks ninth in vulnerability to climate change and that flash floods, landslides and coastal erosion are key hazards. The report explains the 2024 National Adaptation Plan (NAP), climate‑related legislation, and the development of a Climate Change Bill.
    
- **Risk and impact assessment.** Subsection 1.2 summarises observed and projected hazards (temperature, rainfall changes, sea‑level rise and heat waves). It uses historical data and RCP projections to illustrate increasing temperatures and rainfall variability. It also lists impacts on key sectors – water resources, agriculture, tourism, public health, natural resources and human settlements – giving sector‑specific examples such as projected flooding of 25,569 km² of rice fields and the heightened heat‑related health risks.
    
- **Identification of adaptation priorities and barriers.** The A‑BTR cites UNESCAP priorities (strengthening early‑warning systems, resilient infrastructure and dryland agriculture) and lists gaps such as the absence of clear adaptation indicators, uncertainty about long‑term climate impacts, lack of awareness among agencies, limited integration of adaptation into sectoral plans and insufficient technical capacity.
    
- **Outline of sectoral strategies.** Section 1.4 summarises existing strategies for water resources, agriculture, tourism, health, natural resources and human settlements, referencing key plans such as the 20‑Year Water Resources Management Master Plan and the Agriculture Action Plan for Climate Change. It acknowledges “ecosystem‑based adaptation” and “nature‑based solutions” in some sectors.
    
- **Inclusion of M&E and L&D sections.** Section 1.6 describes Thailand’s adaptation M&E framework and notes the need to develop indicators and reporting systems for NAP implementation. Section 1.7 briefly explains disaster early‑warning systems and financial relief measures.
    
- **Case‑study examples.** The report highlights good practices across sectors—for example, the Ban Lim Thong community’s integration of traditional knowledge and ecosystem‑based adaptation for water management and the Thai‑Rice NAMA project’s “3 Increases, 3 Reductions” approach for sustainable rice production.

| **Clear implementation status using MEL categories (yet to start, under implementation, completed, delayed, cancelled)**【Adaptation Chapter of BTR - guiding principles.md†L47-L63】 | The progress section (1.5) provides bullet‑point lists of actions for each sector (e.g., promoting PES, adjusting rice calendars, developing carbon‑footprint hotels) but does not indicate their status, responsible agency or timeframe.                                                                    | Fails to meet good‑practice guidance; readers cannot discern whether actions are ongoing, completed or planned.          |
| **Quantitative indicators and results**【Adaptation Chapter of BTR - guiding principles.md†L64-L75】                                                                                  | Almost no quantitative metrics are given in the progress section. Only the risk assessment table summarises past disasters (numbers of deaths, households affected and economic losses). Indicators such as number of farmers adopting adaptive practices or hectares of mangroves restored are absent.       | Large gap; prevents comparison across time or with other countries.                                                      |
| **Climate rationale linking actions to hazards**【DP - Adaptation Reporting in the Biennial Transparency Report for Developing Nations.md†L20-L33】                                   | Many actions are described generically (“develop green tourism networks,” “enforce building codes”) without explicitly referencing the hazard they address. The guidelines recommend stating, for example, that a dam is designed to cope with a projected 15 % increase in peak rainfall.                    | Weak climate rationale; actions resemble general development measures rather than targeted adaptation.                   |
| **Evidence of implementation** (avoid “paper plan syndrome”)【DP - Adaptation Reporting in the Biennial Transparency Report for Developing Nations.md†L210-L219】                     | The report lists numerous policies and plans but rarely provides evidence that they have been implemented or financed. For instance, the public‑health section notes plans to develop curricula and apps, but there is no data on how many health workers were trained or how many people downloaded the app. | The A‑BTR reflects the “paper plan” syndrome; it focuses on outputs (policies) rather than concrete actions or outcomes. |
| **Integration of private‑sector actions**【DP - Adaptation Reporting in the Biennial Transparency Report for Developing Nations.md†L220-L228】                                        | The report’s progress and case‑study sections emphasise community and government initiatives; private‑sector adaptation (e.g., hotel industry, insurance sector) is almost absent.                                                                                                                            | This results in an incomplete picture of national adaptation efforts and underestimates resilience.                      |
| **Alignment of adaptation and support‑needed narratives**【DP - Adaptation Reporting in the Biennial Transparency Report for Developing Nations.md†L230-L238】                        | The executive summary does not include information on support needs or financial gaps, although the table of contents suggests that Chapter 9 deals with financial support. Without connecting progress to support needs, the narrative could appear inconsistent.                                            | Narrative disconnect; adaptation success is described but not linked to the need for scaling up.                         |
| **Monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL)**【DP - Adaptation Reporting in the Biennial Transparency Report for Developing Nations.md†L240-L244】                                    | Section 1.6 describes an M&E framework and a sectoral focal‑point map, but it does not provide indicators, evaluation results, or lessons learned. The guidelines emphasise that reporting should go beyond counting outputs to analysing effectiveness and failures.                                         | Only the existence of an M&E framework is reported; there is no evaluation of what worked or failed.                     |
| **Cross‑cutting issues (gender, Indigenous knowledge, social inclusion)**【Adaptation Chapter of BTR - guiding principles.md†L152-L160】                                              | The executive summary briefly mentions principles such as human rights, gender responsiveness and local knowledge, but there is no sex‑disaggregated data or discussion of social inclusion in implementation.                                                                                                | Cross‑cutting issues are acknowledged but not operationalised; gender‑responsive indicators are absent.                  |
| **Loss and damage data (including slow‑onset events and non‑economic losses)**【Adaptation Chapter of BTR - guiding principles.md†L120-L160】                                         | The report explains early‑warning systems and financial relief measures, but provides no data on economic or non‑economic losses from slow‑onset events, nor anticipates future losses.                                                                                                                       | Gaps in L&D reporting; incomplete for global stocktake needs.                                                            |

## Pitfalls Identified in the First A‑BTR and Lessons for the Second Report

1. **Paper‑plan syndrome.** The report predominantly lists policies, strategies and master plans without providing evidence of implementation or investment. Best‑practice guidance warns that simply citing laws or plans without corresponding actions is a common pitfall【DP - Adaptation Reporting in the Biennial Transparency Report for Developing Nations.md†L210-L219】. Thailand’s next A‑BTR should pair every policy or plan with concrete activities and outcomes (e.g., number of flood‑diversion projects approved, hectares of mangrove restored).
    
2. **Lack of implementation status and measurable indicators.** The progress section does not indicate whether actions are completed, ongoing or delayed, nor does it provide baseline or target values. The reporting guideline emphasises assigning a clear status to each action and presenting a statistical summary【Adaptation Chapter of BTR - guiding principles.md†L47-L63】. Without this, reviewers cannot determine progress or compare across sectors.
    
3. **Insufficient climate rationale.** Many adaptation actions are generic development measures rather than responses to quantified hazards. This weakens the justification for adaptation finance. A recommended practice is to describe how an action (e.g., raising houses or upgrading irrigation) directly addresses projected increases in flood frequency, drought severity or heat‑wave days.

6. **Omission of private‑sector actions.** The first A‑BTR reports primarily on government and community initiatives, ignoring adaptation by businesses, tourism operators and financial institutions. Such omissions perpetuate the “black box” of private‑sector data【DP - Adaptation Reporting in the Biennial Transparency Report for Developing Nations.md†L220-L228】 and understate national resilience.
    
7. **Disconnect between adaptation achievements and support needs.** A self‑congratulatory progress narrative that is unlinked to the support‑needed section can create confusion. The BTR should treat adaptation reporting as an investment prospectus—highlighting pilot successes and explaining the funding required to scale them【DP - Adaptation Reporting in the Biennial Transparency Report for Developing Nations.md†L230-L238】.
    
8. **Thin monitoring, evaluation and learning.** While Thailand describes its M&E framework, there is little evidence of evaluations or lessons learned. Best practice suggests including a narrative on “what did not work” and how this informed adjustments【DP - Adaptation Reporting in the Biennial Transparency Report for Developing Nations.md†L240-L244】.
    
9. **Neglect of gender and social inclusion.** Cross‑cutting themes (gender equality, Indigenous knowledge, vulnerable groups) are mentioned but not operationalised. Most actions are reported without sex‑disaggregated data or discussion of marginalized groups’ participation. The guidelines advise integrating gender‑responsive approaches and local wisdom throughout the report【Adaptation Chapter of BTR - guiding principles.md†L152-L160】.
    
10. **Gaps in loss‑and‑damage data.** The L&D section focuses on early‑warning systems but lacks data on actual losses, particularly from slow‑onset events and non‑economic impacts (e.g., cultural loss, health impacts). The guidance notes that such data are often missing but are important to include【Adaptation Chapter of BTR - guiding principles.md†L120-L160】.
    

## Gaps That the Second A‑BTR Should Address

1. **Develop a robust MEL system and baseline.** Before the next reporting cycle, Thailand needs to operationalise its adaptation M&E framework by selecting sector‑specific indicators, establishing baselines and collecting data. This will enable reporting on implementation status and outcomes (e.g., number of households protected by flood‑resilient infrastructure; percentage of farmers adopting climate‑smart agriculture; reduction in heat‑related hospital admissions). Without a MEL system, implementation status remains anecdotal.
    
2. **Introduce a common tabular format for progress reporting.** A matrix should link climate hazards, sectors, adaptation actions, implementation status, indicators and results. This narrative‑plus‑table approach facilitates comparison across sectors and over time and meets best‑practice recommendations【Adaptation Chapter of BTR - guiding principles.md†L47-L63】.
    
3. **Provide a climate rationale for each action.** Each adaptation measure should be explicitly tied to a projected climate hazard, with quantitative estimates where possible (e.g., “a seawall designed to withstand 0.3 m of sea‑level rise by 2050”). This strengthens the justification for adaptation finance.
    
4. **Integrate private‑sector contributions.** The second report should collect qualitative and quantitative information on private‑sector adaptation, such as investments by tourism operators, agricultural cooperatives and insurers. Engaging the Joint Standing Committee on Commerce, Industry and Banking (JSCCIB) or industry associations could help to fill this gap.
    
5. **Align adaptation achievements with support needs.** The adaptation chapter should identify pilot projects that have demonstrated success and specify the financial resources required to scale them. For example, if community‑based early‑warning systems reduced flood losses in one province, the report should estimate the cost of replicating them nationwide.
    
6. **Strengthen cross‑cutting reporting.** Include gender‑disaggregated data (e.g., percentage of women farmers adopting climate‑smart practices), document participation of Indigenous and local communities, and explain how traditional knowledge informs adaptation actions.
    
7. **Include loss‑and‑damage data.** The second report should attempt to quantify economic and non‑economic losses from extreme events and slow‑onset processes (e.g., salinity intrusion, land subsidence), even if only for pilot areas. Where data are unavailable, identify the gaps and propose capacity‑building needs.
    
8. **Report on lessons learned.** Dedicate a subsection to evaluating the effectiveness of adaptation measures, identifying which approaches succeeded or failed, and explaining the adjustments made. This learning component demonstrates a mature MEL system and can inform other countries.
    

## Proposed Pathways for Thailand’s Second A‑BTR

### Pathway 1 – Mandatory Compliance and Best‑Practice Alignment

This pathway focuses on meeting the minimum requirements of the MPGs and adhering to reporting best practices recommended for developing countries. It emphasises narrative clarity, process indicators and transparency while acknowledging capacity constraints. The key components are:

1. **Mirror the NAP structure.** Organise the adaptation chapter according to the six priority sectors of Thailand’s NAP so that readers can easily track progress from plan to implementation.
    
2. **Adopt the narrative‑plus‑table format.** For each sector, present a table with columns for climate hazard, adaptation action, implementation status (using categories such as “yet to start,” “under implementation,” “completed,” “delayed” or “cancelled”【Adaptation Chapter of BTR - guiding principles.md†L47-L63】), responsible agency, timeframe, and simple indicators (e.g., number of projects, beneficiaries).
    
3. **Provide a baseline and targets.** Using data from pilot projects and existing sectoral plans, establish baseline values for each indicator and set near‑term targets (to be updated in subsequent reports).
    
4. **Report on institutional arrangements and capacity gaps.** Include an honest account of coordination challenges, technical capacity needs and barriers identified in the first report. Explicitly link these to requests for capacity‑building support.
    
5. **Summarise support received and needed.** Integrate information on adaptation finance, technology transfer and capacity‑building (to be detailed in Chapter 9) with the adaptation narrative, making clear which actions depend on external support.
    
6. **Highlight cross‑cutting initiatives.** Include a dedicated subsection or table to report on gender‑responsive actions, Indigenous knowledge, community participation and social inclusion.
    
7. **Address data gaps transparently.** Where quantitative data are missing (e.g., loss‑and‑damage estimates or private‑sector investments), acknowledge the gap, explain why the data are unavailable and outline plans to collect them before the next reporting cycle.
    

### Pathway 2 – Ambitious Approach Comparable to Developed Nations

This pathway seeks to elevate Thailand’s second A‑BTR to a level that allows comparison with advanced reporting from developed countries. It requires more extensive data collection, integration of financial tracking, and outcome‑based evaluation. Key elements include:

1. **Develop and operationalise a comprehensive MEL system.** Establish digital databases and dashboards to collect real‑time data on adaptation measures across ministries and provinces. Implement climate‑budget tagging so that domestic adaptation expenditures can be aggregated and reported. ￼
    
2. **Adopt outcome and impact indicators.** Move beyond output metrics to assess outcomes (e.g., percentage reduction in flood damages, improvements in crop yields under climate‑smart practices, decline in heat‑related illnesses). Commission academic or research institutions to conduct impact evaluations using counterfactual methods.
    
3. **Quantify the adaptation finance gap.** Calculate the total cost of planned adaptation actions, compare this to domestic and international finance received, and estimate the financing gap. This allows Thailand to contribute evidence to the global adaptation finance debate and strengthens the case for international support.
    
4. **Integrate private‑sector and local‑government data.** Implement reporting mechanisms that require large businesses, state‑owned enterprises and local governments to disclose climate‑related investments and adaptation measures. Include these data in the national adaptation database.
    
5. **Incorporate loss‑and‑damage accounting.** Collaborate with the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation and academic institutions to estimate economic losses from recent extreme events and slow‑onset processes. Explore valuation of non‑economic losses (e.g., cultural heritage sites) and report methodologies and uncertainties.
    
6. **Conduct gender and social‑inclusion analyses.** Include sex‑disaggregated indicators and qualitative assessments of how adaptation measures benefit or impact women, Indigenous peoples and vulnerable groups. Ensure these analyses inform the selection and design of adaptation actions.
    
7. **Use geospatial and high‑resolution data.** Develop interactive maps showing risk hotspots, adaptation projects and progress by province. This enhances transparency and allows comparison with developed‑country reports that utilise GIS dashboards.
    
8. **Publish evaluation results and lessons learned.** Summarise findings from independent evaluations of major adaptation projects, including successes and failures, and outline how lessons are integrated into new policies.
    
9. **Engage in South‑South and international knowledge exchange.** Document Thailand’s contributions to regional adaptation initiatives and technology transfer to neighbouring countries, positioning Thailand as a knowledge hub.
    
10. **Cross‑reference with mitigation and long‑term strategies.** Demonstrate alignment between adaptation actions, NDC targets and the Long‑Term Low‑Emission Development Strategy, highlighting co‑benefits (e.g., mangrove restoration contributing to both adaptation and carbon sequestration).
    

## Conclusion

Thailand’s first A‑BTR lays a foundation for adaptation transparency by following the structure of the ETF MPGs and providing broad qualitative descriptions of climate risks, policy frameworks and good practices. However, it exhibits many early‑report pitfalls—relying on plans rather than implementation evidence, lacking clear status indicators and quantitative metrics, omitting private‑sector actions, and providing limited MEL and L&D information.

To ensure the second A‑BTR meets both the mandatory requirements and positions Thailand as a regional leader in adaptation transparency, the report should transition from narrative listing to evidence‑based progress reporting. By adopting the recommended tabular format, integrating a robust MEL system, articulating a climate rationale for each adaptation action, and addressing cross‑cutting issues and finance gaps, Thailand can produce a transparency report that not only complies with the ETF but also leverages adaptation reporting as a strategic tool for domestic coordination and international support.
