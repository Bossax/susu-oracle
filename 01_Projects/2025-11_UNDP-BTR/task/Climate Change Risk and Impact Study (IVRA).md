## IPCC's definitions of risk and Impact

In IPCC usage, “impacts” are the actual effects of climate change, while “risk” is about the potential for adverse consequences, given hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. The two are related but not interchangeable.

### IPCC definition of impact

In recent IPCC reports, “impact” generally refers to the observed or projected effects of climate change (and related extreme events) on natural and human systems. These effects can be biophysical (e.g. coral bleaching, glacier retreat) or socio‑economic (e.g. reduced crop yields, infrastructure damage, health outcomes), and can be beneficial or adverse, though in practice the focus is often on harmful impacts. Impacts are typically described as what has happened already or what is expected to happen under given climate and socio‑economic scenarios (for example, a 10% decline in wheat yields in a region at 2 °C warming).

### IPCC definition of risk

The IPCC AR6 guidance defines “risk” in general as “the potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognising the diversity of values and objectives associated with such systems.” In the specific context of climate change impacts, risk is framed as emerging from the interaction of climate‑related hazards (e.g. heatwaves, floods), the exposure of people and assets to those hazards, and their vulnerability (susceptibility and capacity to cope and adapt). Risk can also derive from responses to climate change (e.g. maladaptation, mitigation side‑effects), and can in principle include both adverse and beneficial consequences, although IPCC’s formal risk language is anchored in “adverse consequences.”[ipcc+2](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2021/02/Risk-guidance-FINAL_15Feb2021.pdf​

### How impact and risk differ

- Impacts describe realized or modelled effects 
- Impacts are often reported as outcomes conditional on a scenario (e.g. “X% yield loss at 3 °C warming”),
- risks describe the possibility and severity of future adverse consequences, explicitly including uncertainty.
- risks are expressed as the likelihood and magnitude of those adverse outcomes, combined across hazard, exposure, and vulnerability (e.g. “high risk of substantial yield losses for smallholder farmers above 2 °C warming”). 
In short, impacts are the effects themselves; risks are about how probable and how harmful those effects (and responses) could be for particular systems and values.[essd.copernicus+1](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/17/317/2025/)​

We can use ....
## H-E-V concept
We could use the H-E-V concept according to this research paper to categorize the information. 
However, in this case, impact and risk will be very close since risk is essentially expected impact with levels of uncertainties

For BTR adaptation reporting, those two headings can be broken down quite neatly while staying aligned with MPGs and emerging practice. The ideas below are mix‑and‑match; you would only use what fits your national context.

## Impacts, risks and vulnerabilities

- **Observed climate trends and hazards**  
    Key historical climate trends (temperature, rainfall, sea level, extremes), major hazard types (droughts, floods, heatwaves, storms, coastal inundation), and recent notable events and slow‑onset processes, ideally linked to existing VA/NAP work.
    
- **Current and projected impacts by sector and region**  
    Impacts on priority sectors (e.g. agriculture, water, coasts, health, ecosystems, infrastructure, urban systems) and on key regions or hotspots (e.g. deltas, mountain areas, informal settlements), distinguishing observed impacts from modelled or scenario‑based projections.
    
- **Risk profiles (hazard–exposure–vulnerability)**  
    Description of how hazards interact with exposure of people, assets and ecosystems, and with social, economic and ecological vulnerability; can include risk matrices or “high‑risk” systems (e.g. food security, critical infrastructure, key value chains).
    
- **Vulnerability assessment findings and drivers**  
    Main findings from national or sectoral vulnerability assessments; structural drivers such as poverty, inequality, governance gaps, ecosystem degradation, conflict or migration patterns, and how these differ across gender, age groups, Indigenous peoples and other vulnerable groups.
    
- **Distributional, equity and cross‑cutting dimensions**  
    Who is most affected and why (e.g. women, children, Indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, smallholders, fishers, urban poor), including intersectional aspects and the role of gender, social protection, health systems and cultural factors.
    
- **Data, methods and knowledge gaps**  
    Sources of information (observations, scenarios, models, local/Indigenous knowledge), methods used (e.g. qualitative, indicator‑based, probabilistic), limitations, and key data and capacity gaps that affect understanding of impacts, risks and vulnerabilities.
    

## Averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage

- **Overview of loss and damage context**  
    National understanding of loss and damage, including types of climate‑related events and slow‑onset processes that are already causing significant losses, and how this relates to existing adaptation and disaster risk management frameworks.
    
- **Evidence of economic and non‑economic losses**  
    Major recent loss and damage from extreme events (e.g. disaster loss statistics, economic damages to sectors, livelihoods, infrastructure) and from slow‑onset processes (e.g. salinization, glacier melt, sea‑level rise), plus non‑economic dimensions (health, culture, heritage, ecosystems, territory).
    
- **Measures to avert loss and damage (ex‑ante risk reduction)**  
    Policies and actions that reduce hazard, exposure or vulnerability before impacts occur, such as risk‑informed land‑use planning, ecosystem‑based approaches, resilient infrastructure standards, early warning systems, climate‑smart agriculture, and anticipatory actions.
    
- **Measures to minimize loss and damage (preparedness and response)**  
    Systems that limit impacts during and immediately after events, such as multi‑hazard early warning systems, evacuation planning, emergency preparedness, humanitarian response arrangements, contingency planning and climate‑responsive social protection.
    
- **Measures to address loss and damage (recovery, rehabilitation, compensation‑type measures)**  
    Post‑disaster and post‑impact measures like recovery and reconstruction policies, “build back better” programmes, relocation or planned retreat, livelihood diversification support, risk transfer and insurance schemes, shock‑responsive safety nets and other solidarity mechanisms.
    
- **Institutional arrangements and governance for loss and damage**  
    Roles of national and subnational institutions, coordination between disaster risk reduction, climate adaptation, social protection and finance ministries, as well as participation of local governments, communities and Indigenous peoples in relevant decision‑making.
    
- **Finance, technology and capacity for loss and damage**  
    Domestic resources, international support accessed or needed (e.g. funds, facilities, insurance pools), use of innovative finance (e.g. contingency funds, parametric insurance), and needs for technologies, data systems and human capacity to strengthen work on loss and damage.
    
- **Monitoring, learning and knowledge‑sharing**  
    How loss and damage is tracked (indicators, databases, assessments), how lessons from events are captured and used to inform adaptation and DRR, and how the country shares good practices and experiences internationally (e.g. under the Santiago Network or other platforms).
