key_findings:
  - "The marine environment was long considered a 'silent world' until military and research activities in the mid-90s spurred studies on sound impacts."
  - "Public awareness of noise impacts grew in the late 90s due to marine mammal mass stranding events linked to military sonar."
  - "Policymakers face challenges in incorporating scientific findings on underwater noise into impact assessment regulations and environmental policies."
  - "Sound Level Meters (SLMs) are used to quantify impulsive, non-impulsive, and cumulative impacts of different sound sources."

**U.S. context**

- Human are visually oriented species. Our knowledge of the world has been based largely on reasoning and experimentation through visual means.
- the lack of an auditory system that functions efficiently underwater led humankind to consider the marine environment as a “silent world” for eons [Cousteau, J.Y. The Silent World; Harper & Brother Publishers]
- Heart Island Feasibility Test and Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) spurred the studies of impacts of underwater sound on marine mammals in mid 90s
- late 1990s to early 2000s was when the impacts of military application of sound was on public awareness due to marine mammal mass stranding events
- Although evidence of underwater noise impact on marine life, policymakers still find hard times incorporating the findings in impact assessment regulations and environmental policies [Faulkner, R.C.; Farcas, A.; Merchant, N.D. Guiding principles for assessing the impact of underwater noise. J. Appl. Ecol. 2018, 55, 2531–2536]
## Sound Level Meter (SLM)
measure sound within different lengths of periods to quantify impacts of different sound sources
1. impulsive
2. non-impulsive
3. cumulative impact
4. immediate impact
