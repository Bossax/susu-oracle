This note contains comparison results of different studies
# Pair 1



The two studies, "Advancing the Interpretation of Shallow Water Marine Soundscapes" (US study) and "Marine Soundscape as an additional biodiversity monitoring tool - a case study from the Adriatic Sea" (Adriatic Sea study), exhibit distinct approaches to assessing ecosystems, primarily differing in their scale, chosen acoustic metrics, integration of contextual data, and direct methods for noise handling.


## Primary Acoustic Metrics for Biological Sound Assessment

- **US Study***
Primarily relies on various forms of **Sound Pressure Levels (SPLs)**, including Power Spectral Density (PSD) levels, Octave Band Sound Pressure Levels (OLs), and Broadband Sound Pressure Levels (BBLs). The interpretation of these levels for biological activity often requires **integration with source identification** from automated detection algorithms for specific species (e.g., whales, fish grunts).

- **Adriatic Sea Study**
While using **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** to assess the overall spectral composition, it specifically employs the **Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) as a primary proxy for marine sounds of biological origin**. The ACI is highlighted for its ability to distinguish biological sounds and filter out anthropogenic noise.

## Integration of Contextual (Non-Acoustic) Data

- **US Study**
Emphasizes the **"benefit of integrating contextual knowledge"**. It incorporates a wide range of non-acoustic data, such as Automatic Identification System (AIS) for vessel traffic, NOAA buoy data for wind speed, and tidal flow measurements, alongside detailed site features like bathymetry and bottom type. This contextual data is crucial for **interpreting and making meaningful comparisons** of sound levels that would otherwise be ambiguous.

◦ **Adriatic Sea Study**
Uses **in situ biodiversity sampling** with Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) and local scuba diver checklists to identify the _presence_ of soniferous species at the site. Wind speed and sea state were controlled for during recording rather than continuously monitored as variables for soundscape interpretation. Anthropogenic noise is identified but its primary contextualization is through its _impact_ on biological sounds.

## Approach to Noise Separation and Interpretation 

- **US Study**
Recognizes the challenge of "comparing sound levels in isolation" due to interwoven sources and masking. It proposes future "next steps" to advance soundscape analysis, including **estimating residual soundscape conditions** (isolating sound remaining after identifiable sounds are removed) and using **source separation methods** for "denoising" or quantifying specific signals. This study outlines the _need_ for these advanced methods for a more integrated understanding.

- Adriatic Sea Study
Directly utilizes the **ACI as a tool to differentiate biological signals from anthropogenic noise**. It explicitly states that ACI "could effectively filter out noise inputs from technophonies", indicating a more direct application of an acoustic index for noise segregation within its methodological framework. The study notes how noise influenced PSD but not ACI in certain instances, highlighting ACI's utility in discerning biological activity even amidst noise.

The US study, "Advancing the Interpretation of Shallow Water Marine Soundscapes," and the Australia study, "Biological Sound Sources Drive Soundscape Characteristics of Two Australian Marine Parks," both contribute to understanding marine soundscapes but differ significantly in their **objectives, geographical scale, approach to data interpretation, and findings regarding the primary drivers of soundscape characteristics**.

## Duration and Data Volume:

- **US Study:** 
	Utilizes a **large dataset spanning over three years from 30 sites**, with specific examples in the paper using 31 to 60 days of data from various locations.

- **Australia Study:**
	Involves several deployments for each site over approximately a year (between July 2018 and August 2019), with individual deployment periods ranging from **33 to 71 days**.

## Primary Acoustic Metrics:

- **Both studies utilize Sound Pressure Levels (SPLs) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) as core metrics** for characterizing soundscapes.

- The **US study** specifically defines **PSD levels as foundational**, from which Octave Band Sound Pressure Levels (OLs) and Broadband Sound Pressure Levels (BBLs) are derived, all considered forms of "sound levels". It also notes that **acoustic indices have had "mixed results"** in marine environments, often failing to distinguish between different driving features.

- The **Australia study** uses SPL to understand how sound levels change over time and PSD to determine relative sound levels at each frequency over the entire deployment, presenting median, 5th, and 95th percentiles. Long-Term Spectral Averages (LTSAs) are used for visualization and identifying contributors.

## Approach to Identifying Sound Sources:

- **US Study:** Relies on **automated detection algorithms** for specific biological (e.g., whales, fish grunts) and anthropogenic (vessels) sources, alongside the integration of other data.

- Australia Study Primarily employs **trained analysts to manually review spectrograms** for hourly presence of biological and anthropogenic sound sources. An automated detector was used for dolphins in one deployment, and frequency ranges for cetaceans were taken from the literature, while others were determined from PSD peaks or selection tables.

## Integration of Contextual (Non-Acoustic) Data:

◦ **US Study:** Emphasizes the **critical role of integrating diverse contextual knowledge** (such as AIS data for vessel traffic, NOAA buoy data for wind speed, tidal flow measurements, bathymetry, and bottom type) **to** **interpret** **sound level measurements**, which are otherwise considered incomplete or ambiguous.

◦ **Australia Study:** Incorporates contextual data like **wind observations, light regimes, and seasonal periods** to help explain and understand the observed patterns and identify the drivers of changes in SPL and PSD.

## Key Findings on Soundscape Drivers and Anthropogenic Noise Impact:

◦ **US Study:** Demonstrates that **various sources (biological, anthropogenic, abiotic) can lead to similar sound level statistics**, making isolated sound level comparisons challenging. It highlights that **ship noise can often mask biological activity**, necessitating advanced methods for quantification.

◦ **Australia Study:** Concludes that the **soundscape characteristics are primarily driven by biological sound sources**, specifically migratory humpback whale song on a seasonal scale and crepuscular fish choruses and snapping shrimp activity on a diel scale. Critically, it found that **vessel presence, though frequent, did not significantly influence long-term sound level patterns** or create identifiable peaks in SPL or PSD, suggesting these NPZs are **"not yet heavily impacted by anthropogenic noise"** at the study's scale. It also found that seasonal wind speed differences did not correspond to seasonal SPL differences.
