The research projects establish soundscapes of different sites primarily through passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) and subsequent detailed analysis of the recorded underwater sounds.

Here's a breakdown of the common and specific methods used:

**Common Methodologies:**

1. **Deployment of Underwater Recorders (PAM)**: Both studies deployed autonomous underwater acoustic recorders to capture ambient sound [[Hyd

    1. The Australian study used SoundTrap 300 recorders, set to sample at 48 kHz, deployed at depths of 37m and 42m. Recordings were either continuous or on a 30-minute duty cycle to extend battery life.
    2. The Gulf of Riga study utilized SM2M and SoundTrap ST500 recorders with sampling frequencies of 32 kHz and 36 kHz, respectively. Data processing involved 16-bit WAV files, using 20-second time-averaging with a rectangular window function without overlap.
2. **Defining Soundscape Components**: Both projects categorize underwater sounds into biological, anthropogenic, and natural abiotic (geological/climatological) sources.
3. **Establishing Baseline Conditions**: A key objective for both was to provide baseline information on underwater soundscapes to assess current environmental status and enable future comparisons for monitoring efficacy of conservation efforts or impacts.
4. **Utilizing Standardized Metrics**: Both studies computed standardized soundscape metrics to quantitatively explore baseline characteristics.
    1. The Australian study used broadband Sound Pressure Level (SPL) (20 Hz–24 kHz) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) (dB re 1 µPa2/Hz), calculated using PAMGuide software. These metrics provided information proportional to acoustic energy, assessed overall sound levels, and identified key contributors to the soundscape.
    2. The Gulf of Riga study analyzed ambient sound levels using monthly estimated Probability Density Functions (PDFs) in the 500 Hz one-third octave band (TOB), alongside the arithmetic mean and exceedance levels (L95 and L05). PAMGuide software was also used for sound processing.
5. **Assessment of Temporal Patterns and Frequency Overlap**:
    1. The Australian study determined hourly presence of sound sources and analyzed their contributions to diel (daily) and seasonal patterns. They created spectrographic box displays (SBDs) to illustrate potential time and frequency overlap of signals.
    2. The Gulf of Riga study evaluated the co-occurrence of anthropogenic noise and pinniped calls to assess masking risks, comparing hourly detection rates of calls with estimated ship numbers on a weekly basis.

6. **Specific Methodologies for Sound Source Identification and Analysis:**

7. **Manual and Automated Review**:
    1. In the Australian study, trained analysts manually reviewed acoustic data using spectrograms generated in Raven Pro 2.0 to determine the hourly presence of anthropogenic and biological sound sources. Automated detectors like the PAMGUARD Whistle and Moan Detector (WMD) were also used for dolphins. Frequency ranges were determined from Raven selection tables, PSD peaks, or existing literature.
    2. The Gulf of Riga study used a band limited energy detector (BLED) to search for specific pinniped call patterns (frequency ranges, call durations) based on identified calls from previous bioacoustics studies.
8. **Anthropogenic Noise Characterization**:
    1. The Australian study identified vessels by their acoustic signature, using a 500 Hz cutoff to avoid distant, less discernible signals. They found vessels present on most days but not influencing long-term sound levels.
    2. The Gulf of Riga study characterized ship traffic using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, assessing the average daily number and types of ships. Acoustic detection was also used, calculating the excess of ambient sound level over background noise (running minimum of broadband received level). They selected the 500 Hz TOB as a relevant indicator for shipborne noise due to the shallow water conditions.
9. **Biological Sound Characterization**:
    1. The Australian study identified specific biological sources, including dolphins, snapping shrimp, fish choruses, humpback whales, and dwarf minke whales, some identifiable to species, genus, or broader taxonomic categories.
    2. The Gulf of Riga study focused on pinniped calls, specifically grey seal (moan, guttural rup, guttural rupe, percussive signalling/clap) and ringed seal (bark, yelp) vocalizations, noting their social role and increased activity during mating periods.
10. **Environmental Factors**:
    1. The Australian study correlated broadband SPL with crepuscular fish choruses and snapping shrimp activity. They also characterized typical wind conditions using archived weather station data to assess its influence on soundscape metrics.
    2. The Gulf of Riga study observed that ice cover significantly altered the soundscape by lowering natural ambient sound levels and creating favorable sound propagation conditions that increased the detection range of ship noise.
11. **Auditory Masking Assessment**: The Gulf of Riga study specifically assessed the risk of auditory masking for ringed seal calls by anthropogenic noise, following the power spectrum model with a critical ratio (CR). They also estimated the proportion of anthropogenic sound using a signal excess metric.

In essence, both projects combined remote acoustic recording with detailed analytical techniques to identify and quantify the various sound sources contributing to the underwater soundscapes of their respective marine protected areas, providing crucial baseline data for future monitoring and management.
