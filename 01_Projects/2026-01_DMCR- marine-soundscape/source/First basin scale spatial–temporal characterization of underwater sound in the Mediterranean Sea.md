  - "Established nine monitoring stations to capture spatial variability in the Northern Adriatic Sea."
  - "Higher SPLs in low frequencies (63 Hz, 125 Hz) are mainly related to vessel traffic, confirmed with AIS data."
  - "Weather (wind) drives seasonal changes in mid-range frequencies (e.g., 500 Hz TOB)."
  - "COVID-19 lockdown provided a unique scenario to study the impact of reduced human activity on the soundscape."

**Spatial Representation**: The study established **nine monitoring stations** across the Northern Adriatic Sea (NAS), each chosen to encompass diverse environmental characteristics, including proximity to harbors, Natura 2000 sites, fish reproductive areas, and main shipping lanes. 

This allowed for the description of **"inter-station spatial variability"** by comparing the different TOB spectra contours observed at each location. The study highlighted that stations near harbors (Split, Trieste, Rimini, Venice) generally exhibited higher and more variable SPLs, while those near Natura 2000 sites (Ancona, Losinj) experienced lower SPLs.

- **Quantifying Environmental Influences**: The study aimed to describe the underwater soundscape and discuss the results "in the light of available literature". While the study does not use statistical tests to _quantify correlation coefficients_ between changes in specific environmental variables and soundscape metrics directly, it _describes and infers_ the influence of environmental changes on the soundscape based on observed patterns:
    
    - **Anthropogenic Noise (Vessel Traffic)**: A major focus, quantified using **Automatic Identification System (AIS) data** to estimate average vessel density around each station. The study highlights that higher SPLs, particularly in the low frequencies (63 Hz and 125 Hz TOBs, considered proxies for ship-dominated noise), were **"mainly related to vessel traffic"**. The **reduction in SPLs during the COVID-19 lockdown** and the **seasonal increase in passenger and pleasure boats** during spring-summer in certain areas strongly suggest a direct link between vessel traffic density and soundscape levels.
    - **Abiotic Factors (Wind and Waves)**: The study notes that the **500 Hz TOB** is "known to be influenced by wind and weather conditions". It observes that higher sound levels below 2 kHz during autumn–winter months in most stations (except Split) are consistent with a higher number of windy days during that period, **"confirming a general weather-driven rather human-generated seasonal change at the NAS soundscape"** for these frequencies. It also suggests that in shallow waters, local sources like wind and waves are more likely to dominate the soundscape.
    - **Underwater Noise Propagation Conditions**: The study discusses how seasonal variations in **water column properties, bathymetry, and seabed substrates** can influence sound propagation and contribute to seasonal variability in noise levels.

In summary, this study represents the soundscape as a dynamic entity, meticulously measured through frequency-specific SPLs and their distributions over time, and analyzed for both its intrinsic spatial and temporal patterns, as well as its responsiveness to identifiable environmental drivers, particularly human-induced vessel traffic and natural weather conditions. It provides a baseline characterization, acknowledging the "peculiar nature" of the monitoring period due to the COVID-19 lockdown, which paradoxically offers a "unique scenario" for understanding reduced anthropophony.
