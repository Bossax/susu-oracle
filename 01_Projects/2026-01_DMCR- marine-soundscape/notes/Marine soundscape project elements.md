## Review of Proposed Project Management Functions

Your list of main functions for the project management page is well-structured and covers the essential needs for a research-driven, multi-stakeholder initiative like the underwater soundscape project. Below is an assessment of each function, suggestions for refinement, and considerations for completeness.

## 1. Track Progress

- **Purpose:** Essential for monitoring milestones, deliverables, and overall project health.
    
- **Recommendation:** Consider including sub-functions such as:
    
    - Task assignment and status updates
        
    - Milestone tracking (e.g., hardware deployment, data collection phases)
        
    - Gantt chart or timeline visualization
        

## 2. Communicate Progress and Timeline with the Sponsor

- **Purpose:** Keeps sponsors informed, builds trust, and ensures alignment.
    
- **Recommendation:** Ensure this function allows for:
    
    - Automated progress reports
    - Customizable dashboards for sponsors
    - Notification system for key updates or delays
        

## 3. Research Questions

- **Purpose:** Centralizes the evolving scientific, engineering, and data architecture questions.
- **Recommendation:** This is valuable. You might want to:
    - Allow tagging or categorization (e.g., pending, answered, high priority)
    - Provide a discussion/comment section for each question
        

## 4. Resources that Support Decision Making

- **Purpose:** Facilitates evidence-based decisions by organizing relevant literature and resources.
- **Recommendation:** Structure this section for easy navigation:
    - Allow uploading and categorizing resources (articles, journals, reports, websites)
    - Include search and filter options
    - Enable linking resources to specific research questions or decisions
        

## 5. Document Decisions

- **Purpose:** Ensures transparency and traceability of key project decisions in science, engineering, and data architecture.

- **Recommendation:** Make sure to:
    - Record decision rationale, participants, and date
    - Link decisions to related research questions and resources
    - Allow versioning or change logs for decision updates
        

# Potential Additions:
- **Team Collaboration:** A space for team discussions, meeting notes, or direct messaging.
- **Risk Management:** Track risks, mitigation actions, and contingency plans.
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** Mechanism to collect and respond to feedback from stakeholders (e.g., after field validation phases).
- **Data Management:** Tools for managing datasets, metadata, and data sharing permissions.
