# Ship source level
The radiated noise levels of ships are a complex topic influenced by various factors, including ship type, design, operational conditions, and the methodologies used for measurement and data processing.

Here's a breakdown of reported radiated noise levels and related information from the sources:

### Key Terminology

- **Sound Pressure Level (SPL)**: A measure of the amplitude of sound pressure at a specific point, expressed in decibels (dB). In underwater acoustics, the reference pressure is 1 microPascal (µPa).
- **Source Level (SL)**: A theoretical equivalent sound pressure level that would be measured at 1 meter from a simple point source. This metric allows for the comparison of noise levels from different sources, regardless of measurement distance.
- **Radiated Noise Level (RNL)**: The sound pressure level at a given distance from a ship, often without full correction for complex propagation effects like surface reflections.
- **Monopole Source Level (MSL)**: A more rigorously calculated source level that corrects for surface-image reflections (Lloyd's mirror effects), seabed absorption, and other environmental factors, providing a more accurate representation of the source's output as if it were a point source in an infinite, uniform medium. Neglecting these corrections can lead to an underestimation of source levels by up to 35 dB.

### General Characteristics of Ship Noise

- **Dominant Source**: Ships are identified as a **major source of anthropogenic underwater noise**. The propeller and engines/onboard machinery are generally the loudest contributors to a vessel's overall noise profile. At cruise speeds, **propeller cavitation is typically the dominant noise source**.
- **Frequency Range**: Ship noise is primarily **low frequency (typically less than 1000 Hz)**, but can range broadly from below 10 Hz to over 10,000 Hz. Larger commercial vessels tend to have their strongest energy below 1,000 Hz.
- **Variability**: There is a **significant spread, often up to 30 dB**, in reported broadband source levels for ships within the same vessel class and operating under similar conditions. This makes precise prediction for individual vessels challenging without detailed knowledge.

### Radiated Noise Levels by Ship Type

The following are typical and worst-case source levels (in dB re 1 µPa m) and frequency ranges for various anthropogenic continuous noise sources, primarily from the "Modelled Mapping of Continuous Underwater Noise Generated by Activities - GOV.UK" source:

- **Large Commercial Vessels (e.g., cargo ships, container ships, supertankers)**: Generally produce loud noise, typically ranging from **169-198 dB re 1 µPa m**, with energy predominantly below 1,000 Hz.
    - **Bulk Cargo/Carrier**: 175-192 dB, peaking between 20-1,000 Hz.
    - **Container Ship**: 169-198 dB, peaking between 8-33 Hz.
    - **Supertanker**: 180-190 dB, with primary frequencies below 500 Hz (e.g., 7-8 Hz).
    - **Tanker/Freighter**: 169-185 dB, peaking between 20-1,000 Hz.
    - **Ship (general merchant vessel)**: 160-191 dB, peaking between 60-120 Hz.
    - **Vehicle Carrier**: 178-182 dB, peaking between 20-1,000 Hz.
    - Cargo and container ships may have the noisiest acoustic footprint.
- **Dredging Activities**: Emit moderate levels of noise, **150-188 dB re 1 µPa m**, mainly below 500 Hz.
    - **Backhoe Dredger**: 163-186 dB, peaking between 35-500 Hz.
    - **Trailer Suction Hopper Dredger**: 184-188 dB, peaking between 40-500 Hz.
- **Military Sonar**:
    - **Low-frequency sonar**: 215-240 dB, peaking between 100-500 Hz.
    - **Mid-frequency sonar**: 223-235 dB, peaking around 3,500 Hz (range 2,000-8,200 Hz).
- **Oil and Gas Exploration/Operations**:
    - **Drilling (various types)**: 59-171 dB, predominantly low frequency (<250 Hz).
    - **Operational Platforms and Support Vessels**: 196-226 dB, associated with lower frequencies (100-300 Hz).
- **Offshore Wind Farms (Operational Turbines)**: Relatively low, **73-153 dB**, most prominent in the lower frequency range (below 400 Hz).
- **Recreational Craft (e.g., jet skis, speed boats)**: Produce lower levels of noise, **75-159 dB**, highly dependent on speed and operation. These sources often have greater sound energy in higher frequency bands (above 1,000 Hz) compared to large ships.
    - **Jet Ski**: 75-125 dB.
    - **Speed Boat**: 110-156 dB.
    - Small boats can produce high-frequency noise modulated by engine tones, likely from exhaust bubbles, a feature distinct from large vessels.
- **Fishing Vessels**:
    - **Trawler (trawling)**: 147 dB, peaking around 100 Hz (range 40-1,000 Hz).
    - **Fishing boat/trawler (transit)**: 110-158 dB.
- **Passenger Vessels**: 154-155 dB.
- **Port Service Craft (e.g., tugs and barges, workboats)**:
    - **Tug and Barge**: 161-171 dB, peaking between 37-5,000 Hz.
    - **Workboat**: 159 dB, peaking around 630 Hz.

### Factors Influencing Radiated Noise Levels

- **Ship Speed**: A significant positive correlation exists between a ship's source levels and its speed-over-ground. A **speed reduction of 40% can result in approximately a 10 dB decrease in MSL** for merchant ships. However, some ships may exhibit no noise reduction, or even an increase, at speeds below their optimal cruising speed.
- **Ship Dimensions**: A ship's **width** shows a strong positive correlation with broadband source levels (12.03 dB increase for a tenfold increase in width).
- **Propeller and Engine Type**: Propeller cavitation is a primary noise source, and propeller design can significantly impact noise levels. Machinery noise, particularly from diesel engines, also contributes substantially through hull vibrations. Different engine types (e.g., 2-stroke vs. 4-stroke, diesel-electric vs. conventional) can lead to varying noise characteristics.
- **Measurement Methodology and Data Processing**: The closest point of approach (CPA) between the hydrophone and the source, as well as the method for correcting for surface-image reflections, significantly impact reported source levels. The choice of source approximation (RNL vs. MSL) can result in differences of up to 35 dB.
- **Hull Design and Maintenance**: The flow of water past the hull generates flow noise, which is generally weaker than propeller and machinery noise for merchant vessels. Regular hull and propeller cleaning are important maintenance measures to reduce underwater noise by keeping flow and wake conditions optimal.

### Measurement and Reporting Standards

- **Standardized Procedures**: Direct measurement is the most accurate method for determining radiated noise. Several international standards exist for measuring, analyzing, and reporting ship underwater noise, including ISO 17208.
- **Classification Societies**: Six classification societies (American Bureau of Shipping, Bureau Veritas, Det Norske Veritas, Korean Register of Shipping, Lloyd's Register, and Registro Italiano Navale) have developed classification rules for Underwater Radiated Noise (URN) and associated measurement standards. The Korean Register's guidelines, for instance, apply to ships undergoing classification surveys on or after July 1, 2021.
- **Data Accuracy**: Opportunistic measurements (from fixed autonomous stations) are less accurate due to varying acoustic propagation conditions but provide data for large numbers of ships. Dedicated measurements, involving controlled ship movements and multiple hydrophones, offer greater accuracy but are costly.

In summary, the radiated noise levels of ships vary widely by type and operational factors, with large commercial vessels and military sonar often being the loudest. Understanding these levels requires careful consideration of the measurement and calculation methodologies employed.
