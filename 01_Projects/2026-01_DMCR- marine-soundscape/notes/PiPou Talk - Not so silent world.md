The ocean is very noisy 

Fillipe has been in Thailand for 3 years in Andaman sea and GoT

unique locations : acoustically or in general? 

Reef ecology and underwater soundscape
![[Pasted image 20251210190812.png]]

correlate to ecological drivers
we can use acoustics for monitoring and also beyond that

Background: PhD in 2020 working in soundscape since beginning. Focus marine ecoacoustics and informatics lab

32,00 spp of fishes
5000 spp in coral reefs
over 1,000 in Thailand put together Got and Anndaman sea

Habitat quality:
Varieties in
- Diverse substrates
- Benthos
- Nekton
Soundscape is an ecological driver in the reef

Dominant sounds are snapping shrimp


## Importance of sound from perception to production 
sound carries a lot of information
- snapping shrimp 
- shoreline wave breaking

Long-distance information carriers

Fish perceptions
1. Hearing (Pressure)
2. Particle Motion (Vector)

When does sound become crucial?
- Courtship
- Agonistic -> fighting
- Alarm -> seeing predator 

Sound producing structure
- Swim bladder
	- machine gun like
- Stridulation (fin movement)
	- grunting sound
- Bubble release
- Teeth
### Data handling
*2 bands of biophony*
	- crustacean snaps (2 - 20 kHz)
	- fish sound (0.2 - 1.5 kHz)

*Night time*
is more active (represented by SPL)

a lot of ecological processes take place during the night time

### Reef fish life cycle
1. Eggs are released 
2. Larveas go in the water columns and disperse and come back to the reef in the process called settlement
3. Recruit is a smaller  juvenile
4. Juvenile grows into adult

Early life stages are often overlooked
## Soundscapes as ecological drivers

Habitat health
- unhealthy reef is quite in low frequency band
Settlement of larvaes and adults

Recruitment drivers
- hard coral cover
- rugosity (complexity)
- presence of adults
- soundscapes

lower f sound correlates with recruitment rate 

Study areas 2 islands in Taiwan

Rugosity is positive driver

Larvae cannot hear high f sound

Soundscape is a positive driver but not a sole dominant driver. Fish needs other things to settle and survive


## Soundscapes as ecological conservation tool

Soundscape + substrate 

### Impact of anthropogenic noise
- increased stress
- masking
- increased mortality

Hard to see the impact of sound
Even area that is no entry, sound can still travel inside



## Noise study

Ecological indicators + noise indicators (anthrophony)

test in Taiwan 8 sites
high marine and tourism activities

![[Pasted image 20251210194208.png]]
- If we have rich habitat and low human interference => low effort to get high conservation outcome
- Rich habitat with high

SNR

![[Pasted image 20251210194648.png]]


Impact indicator
- "quietness"

Ecological indicators
- substrates
- hard coral cover
- turf algae cover

create a composite score to mix and weigh different indicators to rank habitat quality score
