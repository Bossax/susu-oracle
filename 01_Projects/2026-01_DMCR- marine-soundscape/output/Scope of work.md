### 4.1 Hardware development: hydrophone rigs 

- Specify operational constraints (maintenance cadence, retrieval intervals, diver availability, and shore access) to bound rig size, mass, battery/storage, and handling procedures.
    
- Select the hydrophone and data-logging configuration that meets frequency/sensitivity needs and aligns with retrieval frequency and power/storage constraints.
    
- Design the mechanical rig and mooring (frame, ballast, buoyancy, strain relief, depth rating) to fit site conditions and the maintenance plan.
    
- Address corrosion and biofouling in materials and coatings, and incorporate physical guards and fairings to minimize flow noise and growth on sensitive parts.
    
- Plan time synchronization across hydrophone logger modules using UTC timestamps and verify cross-device clock drift tolerance for downstream labeling.
    
- Compile a bill of materials and spares list (connectors, seals, fasteners, anti-fouling kits, desiccants, strain-relief components) aligned to deployment and maintenance cycles.
    
- Assemble and wire the rig, including proper cable routing, sealing, strain relief, and mounting of the hydrophone, logger, and any auxiliary sensors.
    
- Bench test electronics to verify sampling accuracy, channel functionality, noise floor, and storage/power behavior under expected duty cycles.
    
- Tank test the assembled rig to validate acoustic sensitivity, self-noise, watertight integrity, buoyancy/trim, and mechanical stability under agitation.
    
- Draft the deployment SOP covering site-specific rig handling, diver tasks, installation geometry, retrieval intervals, and in-field health checks.
    
- Create QA/QC checklists for pre-deployment (leak checks, battery/storage status, time sync), in-field checks, and post-retrieval inspections.
    
- Package, label, and inventory all gear and spares, and schedule a readiness review with DMCR to align logistics, retrieval cadence, and inclusion of camera installations within the TOR structure.
    

  

### 4.2 Site shortlisting, pilot deployment, and final site verification

- Shortlist candidate sites that already have routine contextual monitoring (e.g., biological survey, water sampling, temperature, salinity) in collaboration with DMCR.
    
- Plan pilot deployments of one-day duration at the candidate site to assess ambient noise, signal detectability, and field logistics for installation and retrieval.
    
- Evaluate pilot recordings for signal-to-noise, diurnal coverage, and operational feasibility, then select one “healthy” and one “unhealthy” site based on pilot outcomes. 

- Log precise UTC timestamps and device IDs for every recording segment and service visit to ensure cross-domain synchronization and traceability.
    
- Document any site access constraints and weather interruptions during operations to inform retrieval planning and data completeness notes.
    
- Write a summary report on pilot deployment, site selection, and data acquisition plan. 
    
### 4.3 Continuous passive acoustic monitoring at selected sites

- Deploy two hydrophones per site following the verified geometry from step 4.2, anchoring depth and separation to the site’s habitat and activity gradient.kh-esn-okhrngkaar-marine-soundscape-v-2.pdf
    
- Schedule a six‑month monitoring window across both sites to capture seasonal variability and standardize retrievals every 4–5 weeks. 
    
- Retrieve data on each service, swap batteries/storage as needed, and confirm device health, leaks, and cable integrity before redeployment.
    
- Log UTC timestamps, device IDs, deployment/retrieval times, and any configuration changes for each file set and service event. 

    
- Back up raw audio upon landing, verify file integrity, and version the dataset according to the project’s staged data architecture. 
    
- Deliver an interim 3‑month raw‑data package and associated service logs to meet DMCR’s phased milestone expectations. 

    
- Update the deployment SOP and QA checklists with lessons learned after each service cycle to reduce downtime and data loss.

### 4.4 Soundscape analysis

- Collect and store raw recordings with essential metadata in an organized structure that keeps originals intact and traceable.
    
- Review new data for completeness and integrity, resolve issues, and record outcomes in a simple log. 
    
- Prepare analysis‑ready data by organizing recordings into manageable units with consistent labeling and context. 
    
- Maintain clear lineage from raw recordings to prepared datasets so each item can be traced end‑to‑end. 
    
- Package periodic dataset releases with short documentation describing content, scope, and known limitations.kh-esn-okhrngkaar-marine-soundscape-v-2.pdf
    
- Align release timing and contents with agreed milestones (e.g., an interim three‑month data drop) and include service notes. 
    
- Version each release and keep a straightforward changelog so updates are transparent and easy to follow. 
    
- Manage access appropriately prior to public sharing and provide simple guidance on how the data should be cited and used. 
    
- Record decisions and updates to the workflow and refine SOPs over time based on what is learned. 

- Compile daily and weekly summaries of sound levels and frequency patterns to outline each site’s baseline.

- Group acoustically similar events and assign provisional categories such as biological, geological, or human activity.
    
- Cross‑check candidate ship‑noise events with available context (e.g., satelite images or traffic data) to strengthen labeling.
    
- Build simple time series for key phenomena (e.g., fish chorus periods, vessel passes) to reveal daily and seasonal patterns

- Calculate a small set of descriptive indices that track acoustic diversity and intensity over time.Marine-soundscape-kick-off-slide-deck.pdf+1
    
- Compare patterns between the “healthy” and “human‑impacted” sites to highlight differences that matter for management.
    
- Document uncertainties, data gaps, and confounders so interpretations remain cautious and transparent
    
- Summarize findings in a concise analysis report that connects observed patterns to likely drivers and practical implications.
    
### 4.5 Stakeholder communication


- Schedule milestone briefings at Month 3 (site selection summary), Month 6 (interim data handoff), Month 11 (soundscape analysis results), and Month 12 (executive presentation). 
    
- Prepare concise updates that translate findings into management implications (e.g., site contrasts, seasonal patterns, and operational takeaways).
    
- Deliver an interim three‑month raw‑data package with service notes to support DMCR’s phased review and planning.
    
- Conduct a results workshop near Month 11 to review soundscape insights, uncertainties, and options for action. 
    
- Provide a final executive presentation that connects acoustic metrics to ecological status and outlines scale‑up pathways. 
    
- Run a short training and handover session for DMCR staff covering workflow, data access, and how to interpret the reported metrics.
    
- Capture feedback, decisions, and requests in a simple log and incorporate them into the final analysis report.
    
- Align communications with agreed use cases and priorities to keep discussions decision‑focused.
