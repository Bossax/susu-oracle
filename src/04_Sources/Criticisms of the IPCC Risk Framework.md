### Criticisms of the Decoupled IPCC Risk Framework

The IPCC's evolution to a risk framework that decouples hazard, exposure, and vulnerability was a significant conceptual shift intended to provide greater clarity for risk reduction strategies.1 However, this "new paradigm" has faced several criticisms, primarily centered on its practical application and interpretation by the wider research and policy community.2
    
- **Conceptual and Visual Ambiguity:** Some critics argue that the popular IPCC risk diagram, which visually represents risk as the intersection of the three components, can be misleading. They contend that simply superimposing the factors does not adequately represent the complex, underlying definitions, potentially creating more confusion than clarity. This lack of consistency in risk terminology has been a persistent challenge in the disaster risk field.
    
- **Lack of Definitive Guidance:** The IPCC has not explicitly clarified whether the reconceptualization of vulnerability in the AR5 and subsequent reports implies a complete nullification of the older framework. This ambiguity leaves researchers and practitioners uncertain about which framework to apply, contributing to the fragmented use of different models.
    

### Drawbacks of Quantified Risk for Actionability

While the IPCC framework provides a foundation for quantifying risk through indices and models, the resulting information often has limitations that hinder its direct actionability for local decision-makers.

- **Data-Related Challenges:** The quality of any quantitative risk assessment  is fundamentally dependent on the data used. Common drawbacks include:
    
    - **Availability and Quality:** There is often a lack of high-quality, localized, and standardized data, which is essential for an effective and accurate assessment.5
        
    - **Reliance on Historical Data:** QRAs primarily rely on historical data, which provides no guarantee of future performance, especially in a rapidly changing climate.6
        
    - **Applicability:** Data and models are often most reliable when applied broadly. Their ability to definitively forecast outcomes for a specific, individual location is limited.6
        
- **The Illusion of Precision and Certainty:** Quantitative outputs can appear precise and objective, creating a false sense of certainty for decision-makers. In reality, these models contain inherent uncertainties, and the appearance of precision (e.g., risk calculated to multiple decimal points) does not improve the accuracy of the forecast. This can lead to overconfidence in models that were "oversold and overbought" by users seeking a level of certainty that the models cannot provide.8

- **Oversimplification of Complex Realities:** To make quantification manageable, models often rely on simplifying assumptions that may not reflect reality.
    
    - **Static Nature:** Assessments are often static, capturing a snapshot in time rather than the dynamic and evolving nature of risk.9
        
    - **Ignoring Interdependencies:** Models may incorrectly assume that risk factors are independent and mutually exclusive. In reality, disasters often result from multiple, dependent low-probability events occurring in combination.6
        
    - **Exclusion of Key Factors:** Many quantitative techniques struggle to adequately incorporate crucial but hard-to-measure factors like organizational culture, human error, and other social dynamics.6
        
- **Hindrance to Action:** The combination of these factors can make quantified risk information difficult to apply. The use of heterogeneous and case-specific methodologies makes it difficult to compare results across different studies or locations, which can be confusing for policymakers who are not experts on the topic.1
    

### Integrating Social Context for Effective Decision-Making
To make risk information truly actionable and equitable, it must be used in conjunction with frameworks that are explicitly aware of the social context. A purely technical risk assessment is insufficient because climate change disproportionately affects the most vulnerable segments of society.

The following should be used to complement quantitative risk assessments:

1. **Social Vulnerability Assessments:** Decision-making must be informed by a specific analysis of **social vulnerability**. This refers to the inherent characteristics of a population—based on factors like age, income, race, gender, health status, and disability—that make them more susceptible to harm and less able to prepare for, respond to, and recover from climate impacts.11 Social vulnerability is largely a product of pre-existing social inequalities.12 A dedicated assessment helps identify _who_ is most at risk and _why_, allowing for the development of targeted and equitable interventions.
    
2. **A "Just Resilience" Framework:** Beyond simply identifying vulnerable groups, decision-making should be guided by principles of climate justice. This approach, sometimes called "Just Resilience," places justice and equity at the _core_ of the adaptation process, rather than treating them as secondary considerations. Key tenets of this approach include:
    
    - **Addressing Root Causes:** Actively confronting the structural inequities and historical injustices—such as poverty, social exclusion, and marginalization—that are the root causes of vulnerability.
    - **Participatory and Inclusive Governance:** Ensuring that adaptation strategies are grounded in local realities by combining top-down and bottom-up approaches. This requires creating processes where the voices of marginalized groups, including women, Indigenous communities, and low-income residents, are prioritized in planning and decision-making.
    - **Holistic and Context-Specific Policies:** Adopting a holistic view that considers the interplay between climate risks and the complex economic, political, and social realities that people face. This ensures that adaptation policies are locally relevant and culturally appropriate.
        

By combining quantitative risk data with a deep, qualitative understanding of social vulnerability and a commitment to procedural justice, decision-makers can move beyond a purely technical exercise and develop adaptation strategies that are not only effective but also equitable and sustainable.
