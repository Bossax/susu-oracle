**ai**: The Terms of Reference (TOR) explicitly require the compilation of baseline data categorized by international risk assessment frameworks, which include the following key data domains [^1]:

-   Climatic Driver
-   Hazard (e.g., Flood, Drought, Heat)
-   Exposure (Location of people/assets)
-   Sensitivity
-   Adaptive Capacity
-   Impact (Damage/Loss)
-   Response
-   Loss and Damage from Climate Change

Additionally, the National Climate Adaptation Information Framework, which the consultant must develop, needs to contain at least [^2]:

-   Climate Data
-   Risk and Impact Assessment Data
-   Adaptation Guidelines and Examples
-   Adaptation Implementation Results
