**user**: how many meeting/ focus group discussions, and workshops are there in this project
[Timestamp: 2025/11/06 11:44:53]

**ai**: Based on the provided notes, the CRDB project includes several stakeholder engagement activities:

*   **Interviews and Focus Groups:** The project will conduct at least **10 semi-structured interviews and focus groups** with data producers and consumers. These are planned during the Data Landscape and Requirements Assessment phase (WP 2) to understand user needs, use cases, and pain points [^1, ^2].

*   **Validation Workshops and Focus Groups:**
    *   During the conceptual design phase (WP 3), **workshops and focus groups** will be held with DCCE technical staff and other stakeholders to review and refine the National Climate Adaptation Information Framework (NCAIF) and data architecture models [^1].
    *   In the knowledge synthesis phase (WP 5), additional **focus groups and training sessions** will be organized to validate the final outputs, including the NCAIF, data inventories, and the Minimum Viable Dataset (MVD) [^1].

*   **Dissemination Workshops:** The project will support DCCE in hosting **dissemination workshops** to present the final project outputs to a broader audience [^1].

In summary, the project plans for at least 10 initial interviews/focus groups, followed by an unspecified number of validation workshops, focus groups, and dissemination events throughout the project lifecycle.
