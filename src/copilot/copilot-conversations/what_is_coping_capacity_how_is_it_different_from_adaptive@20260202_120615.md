**ai**: Based on the provided context, "coping capacity" is an earlier term for what is now more commonly referred to as "adaptive capacity," especially in the context of climate change.

According to the note [[Studies on adaptive capacity to climate change a synthesis of changing concepts, dimensions, and indicators]], adaptive capacity was previously termed "coping capacity" by the IPCC in 2001 [^1].

The primary difference is one of terminological evolution rather than a fundamental conceptual split. The concept has broadened over time. While "coping capacity" was the initial term, "adaptive capacity" is now used to describe a system's flexibility and ability to manage stresses, mobilize resources, manage risk, and adjust to change [^1]. Adaptive capacity is seen as a positive attribute that lessens vulnerability to climate change by enabling a system to manage its exposure and sensitivity [^1, ^2].

In essence, the term evolved from "coping capacity" to the more comprehensive "adaptive capacity" to better capture the range of factors involved, such as economic resources, technology, skills, infrastructure, and institutions [^1].
