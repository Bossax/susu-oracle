**ai**: The [[CRDB - Implementation Plan]] outlines a project timeline spanning 270 days, structured around six work packages (WPs) and seven key milestones [^1]. The project focuses on designing conceptual frameworks, metadata specifications, and workflows for a climate-adaptation information system, rather than building software [^1].

Here is the timeline with key tasks for each milestone:

| Milestone | Description | Day (from contract signature) | Key Tasks (Work Package Objectives & Activities) |
| :-------- | :---------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **M1 – Inception report and stakeholder plan** | Completion of WP 1; inception report and engagement plan delivered | **30** | **WP 1: Project Initiation and Inception** - Establish shared understanding of project scope, refine Terms of Reference (TOR) language into technical terms, develop detailed plans, conduct kick-off and scope refinement, prepare work plan and inception report, map stakeholders, and review international platforms and DCCE systems [^1]. |
| **M2 – Data landscape report** | Completion of WP 2; data landscape & gap report and interview summaries delivered | **90** | **WP 2: Data Landscape and Requirements Assessment** - Understand existing data flows, systems, and user needs. Activities include desk research and benchmarking of international platforms, current-state assessment of DCCE and partner agencies' data practices, user requirement interviews (at least 10), and GIS and spatial data readiness assessment [^1]. |
| **M3 – Conceptual architecture & NCAIF** | Completion of WP 3; conceptual data architecture, NCAIF specification and draft governance framework delivered | **120** | **WP 3: Conceptual Design of the Data Architecture and NCAIF** - Develop conceptual models for the Data Lakehouse (Medallion architecture), metadata service, and the National Climate Adaptation Information Framework (NCAIF), and prepare governance guidelines. Activities include refining the NCAIF ontology, defining conceptual data flows, designing the metadata service, drafting the data governance framework, and validating models through focus groups [^1]. |
| **M4 – Draft inventories & MVD design** | Initial population of baseline data and product inventories and the MVD schema delivered | **180** | **WP 4: Development of Data and Knowledge Assets & MVD** - Populate the Baseline Data Inventory and Information Product Catalog, and design the Minimum Viable Dataset (MVD) schema. Activities include inventory template design, dataset and product registration, and MVD design based on DDPM’s PDNA forms and the Sendai Framework [^1]. |
| **M5 – Gap analysis & pilot** | Gap analysis report and pilot demonstration of the MVD and inventories delivered | **200** | **WP 4: Development of Data and Knowledge Assets & MVD** (continued) - Perform gap analysis by comparing user requirements to populated inventories, and conduct a prototype demonstration using the inventories and MVD schema for a past disaster event [^1]. |
| **M6 – Knowledge synthesis & validation** | Knowledge synthesis report, validated inventories, training and communication materials delivered | **230** | **WP 5: Knowledge Synthesis, Stakeholder Engagement and Dissemination** - Synthesize adaptation knowledge across NAP sectors, design communication materials, build capacity, and validate outputs. Activities include systematic review of literature, stakeholder validation and capacity building sessions, development of communication materials, and dissemination events [^1]. |
| **M7 – Final deliverables** | Evaluation report, recommendations, final project report and knowledge‑transfer sessions delivered | **270** | **WP 6: Evaluation, Recommendations and Closure** - Evaluate project outputs, consolidate recommendations for future implementation, and ensure knowledge transfer. Activities include defining evaluation criteria, developing a roadmap for physical system implementation, compiling final documentation, and conducting handover sessions with DCCE staff [^1]. |
