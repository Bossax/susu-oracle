**ai**: The note [[Use cases of climate data and information]] contains the result of deep research about a national adaptation information framework, which is conceptualized as a "Climate Change Data Ecosystem" (CCDE) [^1], [^3]. This note details the architecture, the imperative for actionable intelligence, the four pillars (data domains of the adaptation cycle), and a typology of information applications for such a framework [^1], [^2], [^4], [^5].

Additionally, the note [[National Climate Adaptation Information Framework]] provides a detailed "Business Taxonomy" for a National Climate Adaptation Information Framework (NCAIF), outlining its stages and components [^6]. This also represents a result of deep research into the structure of a climate information platform.

**ai**: The note [[Use cases of climate data and information]] mentions the EU's Climate-ADAPT platform as an example of a curated catalogue of adaptation options [^1]. While it doesn't provide a comprehensive "review" of multiple key climate information platforms, it does refer to a significant EU platform within the context of adaptation strategy and measures data.
