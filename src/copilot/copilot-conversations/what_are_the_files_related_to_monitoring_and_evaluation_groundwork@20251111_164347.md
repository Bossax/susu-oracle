**user**: what are the files related to monitoring and evaluation groundwork of Thailand
[Timestamp: 2025/11/11 16:43:47]

**ai**: I don't have any specific files related to the "monitoring and evaluation groundwork of Thailand" in my current context.

If you'd like me to search your Obsidian vault for this information, please let me know by using `@vault` in your query, for example: "What are the files related to monitoring and evaluation groundwork of Thailand @vault".

[Timestamp: 2025/11/11 16:44:04]

**ai**: Based on the provided context, the file related to Thailand is:

*   [[Flood 2025 Risks and Impacts]] [^1]

This document discusses projected rainfall, storm frequency, monsoon effects, and water levels in dams for Thailand in 2025, assessing the likelihood and potential impacts of flooding. While not explicitly titled "monitoring and evaluation groundwork," this information provides critical context and data that would be essential for any monitoring and evaluation activities related to disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, or development projects in Thailand.

*   [[Monitoring and Evaluation for Adaptation - Lessons from Development Co-operation Agencies]] [^1]

This document defines Results-Based Management (RBM) and its components, including implementation and result measurements, in the context of development co-operation agencies [^2]. It specifically addresses the selection of indicators for adaptation initiatives, emphasizing the need for qualitative, quantitative, and binary indicators, and highlights the limitations of output measurement alone, such as not capturing the impact on adaptive capacity [^3]. Furthermore, it details how and when indicators are obtained, stressing that the timing of monitoring and evaluation activities for adaptation initiatives needs to be adjusted to the longer time horizon of climate change impacts, often requiring additional evaluations after project completion to verify long-term impacts [^4].

**ai**: Based on the provided context, the file that discusses adaptation monitoring and evaluation is:

*   [[Monitoring and Evaluation for Adaptation - Lessons from Development Co-operation Agencies]] [^1]

This document, an OECD working paper, focuses on "Monitoring and Evaluation for Adaptation: Lessons from Development Co-operation Agencies" [^1]. It defines Results-Based Management (RBM) and its components, including implementation and result measurements, specifically in the context of development co-operation agencies [^1]. The document details the selection of indicators for adaptation initiatives, emphasizing the need for a combination of qualitative, quantitative, and binary indicators, and highlights the limitations of relying solely on output measurement, such as not capturing the impact on adaptive capacity [^1]. Furthermore, it discusses how and when indicators are obtained, stressing that the timing of monitoring and evaluation activities for adaptation initiatives must be adjusted to the longer time horizon of climate change impacts, often requiring additional evaluations after project completion to verify long-term impacts [^1]. It also covers challenges in setting baselines for adaptation, including changing baselines and the uncertainty of extreme events, and the role of the Logical Framework Approach (LFA) as a common M&E tool for adaptation [^1].
