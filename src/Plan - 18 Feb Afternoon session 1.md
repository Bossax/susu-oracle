# Session Plan: 18 Feb 2026 - CRI Phase 2 methodology hypothesis testing

## Objective

*   understand project risks and gaps according to the current literature review
* identify areas of further research to refine methodology to be more practical and relatable by DCCE staff and local officials
- structure data analysis plan to collect and curate more datasets
## Hypothesis

* The middle pathway strategy of [[CRI Phase 2 Methodology]]is  the most viable path to balance between usefulness of the data product and the potential buy-in of DCCE staff who is not sloid in adaptation theory and frameworks 
* There will be ways to leverage the existing data collected by other line agencies such as DOPA etc to measure the process indicators

## Tasks

*   read the [[Validating a Management Science Approach to Measuring Coping, Adaptive, and Transformative Capacities in Municipal Climate Resilience Using Administrative Data]] to understand the current state of knowledge
* create implementation strategies to address the issues in [[Critique of CRI Phase 2]]
## Expected Outcome

* more concrete methodology inline with the findings of the literature review and the practicality
