This guidebook, published by UNEP DTU Partnership in March 2018, compiled knowledge and unique perspectives from global experts and practitioners on measuring, aggregating, and comparing adaptation results.

# Key Concepts and Terminology 
The publication primarily focuses on the **quantitative assessment** of adaptation outcomes rather than processes. While the title uses 'metrics,' other terms like 'indicators' are often used interchangeably within the volume. A distinction can be made where 'indicators' refer to the element of adaptation success being assessed (e.g., vulnerability level), and 'metrics' refer to the specific unit of measurement (e.g., a vulnerability index value). There is **no universal agreement on terminology** among experts.

# Overarching Context and Challenges 
The need for meaningful adaptation metrics is gaining political and academic importance due to the need to prioritize funding for vulnerable groups and assess the results of adaptation investments. The **Paris Agreement's global goal on adaptation** (enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience, reducing vulnerability) stresses the urgency of measuring and tracking adaptation progress across different levels over time.

A central challenge is the **absence of a clear, all-encompassing metric** like CO2 equivalents for mitigation, leading to a "hodgepodge" of monitoring, reporting, and evaluation (M&E) frameworks. Key challenges highlighted include:

1. **The gap between theory and practice**, where practitioners develop de facto approaches due to a lack of global consensus.
2. The **importance of context**, as appropriate metrics vary significantly depending on scale (local, national, international), sector (agriculture, disaster-risk), and specific socio-economic and environmental contexts. This context-specificity makes results aggregation difficult.
3. The inherent difficulty in **distinguishing adaptation from development**, complicating measurement efforts.
4. The conceptual and methodological complexities mean there is **no single, uniform, and universally applicable metric** to measure adaptation progress.

# Conceptual and Methodological Perspectives 
This section delves into the evolution and complexities of adaptation metrics:

- **Evolution under UNFCCC:** Adaptation metrics have evolved from identifying vulnerability and prioritizing needs to monitoring adaptation actions and evaluating their effectiveness, adequacy, and collective progress, especially after the Paris Agreement.

- **Prioritizing Adaptation Needs:** Early efforts focused on defining "particularly vulnerable" countries, but scientific and political dimensions have hindered agreement on a systematic, agreed-upon method for assessing and comparing vulnerability.
- **Monitoring and Evaluation of Actions:** M&E became crucial for accountability of climate funds, using process and outcome/impact indicators. National-level M&E gained momentum, but indicators vary widely (e.g., quantitative measures like "number of people benefiting" versus qualitative measures like "degree of integration"). There is agreement that "success is context-specific and dynamic".

- **Evaluating Effectiveness, Adequacy, and Collective Progress:** The global stocktake under the Paris Agreement requires assessing the overall progress towards the global goal on adaptation. This highlights the need for metrics allowing aggregation of national efforts. However, debates persist on whether reviews should be national or global, with many citing the difficulty of developing a "universal metric".

- **Pitfalls of Adaptation Metrics:** Key pitfalls include the absence of a single universal metric, the lack of a single, objective set of indicators for adaptation needs, and the ==limited applicability of vulnerability indices for funding allocation due to inherent value judgments==. Additionally, *tracking only processes or spending can mislead conclusions* about actual adaptation, and no single metric can fulfill all M&E purposes simultaneously. Metrics alone cannot explain _why_ changes occur, limiting learning and potentially misguiding decisions if complex issues are oversimplified into single numbers. #vulnerability_indicator 

- **Potential of Adaptation Metrics:** National adaptation M&E systems offer opportunities for understanding progress and informing decisions. There is potential for **improved connectivity and synergies** by aligning monitoring across related policy themes like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR). ==Deliberately designing M&E for **learning** can provide crucial insights complementing accountability-focused indicators==. Finally, considering **transformational adaptation** in M&E can lead to a better understanding of systemic changes.

- **Universal Metrics for Adaptation Effectiveness:** Concepts like "Saved Wealth" (economic benefits) and "Disability-Adjusted Life Years Saved" (DALYs) are assessed as potential candidates for generic effectiveness metrics. However, applying these is complex due to uncertainties and data intensity.

# Practical Experiences and Lessons (Section B) 
This section presents real-world applications and lessons learned:

- **Developing Meaningful Local Metrics (TAMD Framework):** The Tracking Adaptation Measuring Development (TAMD) framework helps local and national governments improve adaptation efforts. It involves assessing institutional capacity for climate risk management (Track 1) and linking activities to changes in resilience and well-being (Track 2) using indicators. Applications in Kenya, Tanzania, Mali, and Senegal used scorecards and theories of change, demonstrating the need to **contextualize indicators to local realities**. Learning included the importance of linking activities to climate risks, adapting scorecards for local contexts, integrating gender dimensions, and developing local M&E plans with feasible data collection. Aggregation can occur through comparing relative changes over time or linking to district/national plans.

- **Designing, Setting Up, and Implementing M&E in Madagascar:** Three projects (AF-Rice, PAZC, "Enhancing adaptation capacities...") in Madagascar use diverse metrics like vulnerability indices, institutional capacity scores, and changes in productivity. Challenges include data availability, scope definition, high costs for complex indicators, and weak institutional coordination for data collection. A robust M&E strategy with a Performance Measurement Framework (PMF) is essential for effective project-level M&E.

- **Setting up a National Monitoring System in Germany:** Germany established an indicator-based monitoring system for its Adaptation Strategy (DAS) to **track climate change impacts and adaptation processes**, comprising 102 indicators (55 impact, 42 response, 5 cross-cutting). The system relies on existing data sources and emphasizes transparency. Challenges include data gaps at the federal level for certain themes and the complexity of isolating climate change-specific consequences.

- **Development of National and Sub-National Adaptation Metrics in Kenya:** Kenya developed a Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV+) system as part of its National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP). This system, based on the TAMD concept, aims to aggregate sub-national data nationally. A feasibility study in Isiolo County showed that sub-national adaptation indicators often resemble development indicators due to shared development deficits. Lessons include prioritizing indicators with accessible data, ensuring cross-sectoral benefits, and emphasizing participatory approaches for local ownership.

# Measuring Adaptation Benefits: Technology Needs Assessments (TNAs) and Funding Requirements

This section examines how countries measure the benefits of adaptation technologies in TNAs and aligns this with Green Climate Fund (GCF) requirements. TNAs identify technology priorities and assess benefits (social, economic, environmental). Methodological challenges include baseline data scarcity, uncertainties in climate projections, and attributing benefits to specific technologies. TNAs can provide valuable information for GCF proposals, particularly regarding impact potential, sustainable development potential, recipient needs, and country ownership, but often require further refinement for economic efficiency and transformational impact.

- **Assessing Results of Climate Change Adaptation Projects in Practice (GIZ):** Germany's development cooperation agency, GIZ, integrated adaptation into its existing Results-Based Monitoring (RBM) system. They piloted complementary approaches: monitoring climate vulnerability/risk over time, "Saved Health" and "Saved Wealth" metrics, and empirical impact evaluations. Key lessons from GIZ include the effectiveness of integrating adaptation into project development, the need for complementary M&E approaches for outcomes, considering practical realities (timing, budget), and the limitations of single aggregate indicators.
- **Indicators for Monitoring and Evaluation Adaptation within Health Systems:** Health systems are increasingly developing indicators for climate-sensitive health outcomes (e.g., mortality from heatwaves, incidence of infectious diseases), health vulnerability, health adaptation and resilience, and inter-sectoral coordination. Challenges include the availability of long-term and fine-scale data, the complexity of multiple interacting drivers, and resource constraints for M&E.
