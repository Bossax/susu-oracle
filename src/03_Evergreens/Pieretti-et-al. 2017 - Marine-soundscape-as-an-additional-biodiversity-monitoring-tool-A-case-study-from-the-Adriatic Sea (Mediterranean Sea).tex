\subsubsection{Time series of both Power Spectral Density (PSD) and
Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) were
computed}\label{time-series-of-both-power-spectral-density-psd-and-acoustic-complexity-index-aci-were-computed}

\begin{quote}
Time series of both Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Acoustic Complexity
Index (ACI) were computed, though with some distinctions regarding the
FFT sample window.

\textbf{Power Spectral Density (PSD)}:~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  PSD was calculated on \textbf{every one-minute acoustic file} by
  applying a series of short-term FFTs.
\item
  The \textbf{FFT size used for PSD was 2048 points}. {{39.063 Hz
  frequency resolution}}
\item
  PSD levels above 620 Hz were compiled into 312 Hz bins to match ACI
  settings and improve visibility for fish vocalizations at low
  frequencies.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI)}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The study performed \textbf{two parallel ACI analyses} with different
  FFT setting
\item
  \textbf{ACI (FFT 2048)} was used for the \textbf{0--620 Hz frequency
  range}, primarily associated with fish vocalizations. This setting
  provided a higher resolution for low-frequency bands.
\item
  \textbf{ACI (FFT 256)} was used for \textbf{frequency bins above 620
  Hz}, primarily associated with snapping shrimp sounds. For this higher
  frequency band (620 Hz--40 kHz). The frequency resolution is
  \textbf{312 Hz}.
\item
  an \textbf{amplitude filter of 5000 μV²/Hz} was applied to consider
  only louder snaps and prevent biases from dense snap presence.
\end{itemize}

Both PSD and ACI values were then used to create \textbf{3D
interpolation maps} and track hourly circadian rhythm patterns,
indicating the generation of time series data from these computations.
