#Adaptive_capacity_baseline  is a description of the **current capacity within a priority system to cope with and adapt to climate variability**

According to AR5 adaptive capacity = potential for adaptive action rather than guaranteeing the action itself

>[!QUoTE]
>Adaptive capacity, therefore, depends on the ability of a society to act collectively, and to resolve conflicts between its members – factors that are heavily influenced by ==governance==.



> [!QUOTE] 
> At the local level, adaptation is a complex process that “emerges” as social systems reorganise themselves, in a largely unplanned fashion, through a series of responses to external stresses. Top-down, prescriptive strategies to undertake planned adaptation are therefore only a partial solution.
# Indicators of adaptive capacity
adaptive capacity is not directly measurable
a score card approach was used by UNDP-GEF (2003) for assessing changes in capacity attributable to a project

>[!question] 
>- If adaptive capacity is difficult to measure, projects that aims at adaptive capacity are not measureable?
>- What changes in the context of modern risk framework? #Question 

## Question-Based Approach to Identify Indicators:
 a set of **nine questions** to help identify applicable indicators for assessing adaptive capacity, often posed to stakeholders:
	1. What is the nature of the system/population being assessed?
	2. What are the principal hazards faced by this system/population?
	3. What are the major impacts of these hazards and which elements/groups are most vulnerable?
	4. Why are these elements/groups particularly vulnerable?
	5. What measures would reduce their vulnerability?
	6. What are the factors that determine whether these measures are taken?
	7. Can we assess these factors to measure the capacity to implement these measures?
	8. What are the external and internal barriers to implementation?
	9. How can capacity constraints be removed from key barriers to adaptation?

These questions help in understanding the existing capacities and the constraints to realizing adaptive potential, which are crucial for the baseline assessment.
