### Time series of both Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) were computed

> Time series of both Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) were computed, though with some distinctions regarding the FFT sample window.
>
> **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**: 
>
> *   PSD was calculated on **every one-minute acoustic file** by applying a series of short-term FFTs.
>
> *   The **FFT size used for PSD was 2048 points**. <span style="color: rgb(19, 19, 20)"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 212, 0, 0.5)">39.063 Hz frequency resolution</span></span>
>
> *   PSD levels above 620 Hz were compiled into 312 Hz bins to match ACI settings and improve visibility for fish vocalizations at low frequencies.
>
> **Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI)**:
>
> *   The study performed **two parallel ACI analyses** with different FFT setting
> *   **ACI (FFT 2048)** was used for the **0–620 Hz frequency range**, primarily associated with fish vocalizations. This setting provided a higher resolution for low-frequency bands.
> *   **ACI (FFT 256)** was used for **frequency bins above 620 Hz**, primarily associated with snapping shrimp sounds. For this higher frequency band (620 Hz–40 kHz). The frequency resolution is **312 Hz**.
> *   an **amplitude filter of 5000 μV²/Hz** was applied to consider only louder snaps and prevent biases from dense snap presence.
>
> Both PSD and ACI values were then used to create **3D interpolation maps** and track hourly circadian rhythm patterns, indicating the generation of time series data from these computations.
