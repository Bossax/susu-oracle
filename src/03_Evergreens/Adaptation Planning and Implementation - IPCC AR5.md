Knowledge of impacts and vulnerabilities does not necessarily lead to the most cost-effective and efficient adaptation policy decisions

The literature also illustrates a **high heterogeneity in adaptation planning**, which is linked to the context-specific nature of adaptation


# Impact-focused approach blinds us
A key characteristic observed in the **early stages of adaptation planning and implementation is a prominent focus on climate change impacts and disaster risk management (DRM)**. This impact-led approach, while acknowledged as a crucial element of adaptation, has generated several concerns:

- A strong focus on impacts can **overshadow the analysis of underlying stressors of hazards, neglecting the drivers of vulnerability**.
- It may **limit the effectiveness of interventions** by obscuring opportunities to connect development pressures, poverty, social inequality, and climate change, particularly for reducing social vulnerability.

- Knowledge of impacts and vulnerabilities does not necessarily lead to the most cost-effective and efficient adaptation policy decisions, partly due to the uncertainties associated with future climate and socioeconomic conditions, and the context-specific nature of adaptation.
- Early adaptation plans often prioritize **defensive infrastructure**. There is a recognized need for these plans to transcend such fragmented, defensive approaches and evolve into multidimensional policy processes that acknowledge adaptation as a continuous learning process.

# Low-Regrets Measures

Against this backdrop, **Low-Regrets Measures are identified as crucial starting points** in adaptation planning and implementation within the larger context of adaptation and disaster risk management

>[!important] Definition
>Low-regrets measures are explicitly defined as **measures that provide benefits under current climate conditions and across a range of future climate change scenarios**.


**Starting Points**: They are seen as **starting points for addressing projected trends in exposure, vulnerability, and climate extremes** in national and regional adaptation plans. This is because they have the potential to **offer benefits immediately and lay the foundation for addressing future climate changes**.

**Addressing Concerns**: The sources suggest that using low-regrets strategies and actions, particularly when combined with top-down and bottom-up approaches in both DRM and adaptation planning, can **increase climate resilience, improve livelihoods, reduce development pressures, and strengthen economic and social well-being**. This approach can also **help alleviate the concerns of limiting the effectiveness of policy interventions** that arise from a narrow impact-focused view. The most attractive adaptation actions are often those that offer development benefits in the relatively near term, alongside reductions in vulnerabilities over the longer term. This aligns well with the concept of low-regrets measures, which inherently offer co-benefits.

**In the larger context of Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management (DRM)**:
- Climate change adaptation (CCA) is recognized as a response to multiple stresses, emphasizing the need to connect it with development strategies and plans, and DRM.

- The way adaptation is framed significantly influences its importance; for instance, viewing it as a **public safety or development issue tends to resonate more effectively within local government**. Multilateral development agencies actively promote efforts to link adaptation with development needs and challenges.

- While climate change impacts and DRM are crucial in early adaptation stages, there's a need to integrate them more deeply with development to address the root causes of vulnerability.

- The IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) highlighted the complementary aspects and differences between DRM and CCA. DRM, by managing hazards from extreme weather events, helps communities deal with the uncertainty of climate change
.
- Although DRM and CCA are often managed by separate agencies, proponents advocate for their merger due to shared objectives, which would avoid duplicated efforts. Strengthening the integration of CCA with development, and linking DRM and CCA to existing development pressures and community welfare, can reduce unintended consequences of adaptation and foster support from stakeholders.

- Viewing both DRM and CCA as **continuous learning processes** can facilitate the creation of integrated approaches for national and local development strategies and plans, helping to address social vulnerabilities stemming from inequalities. The effectiveness of policy interventions can be enhanced by combining top-down and bottom-up approaches with low-regret strategies.

# Monitoring and Evaluation
 
 Few adaptation plans have been monitored and evaluated. There is a tendency in the literature to consider adaptation planning a problem-free process capable of delivering positive outcomes. This approach risks underestimating the complexity of adaptation as a social process, potentially leading to unrealistic societal expectations and overestimating planning's capacity to deliver intended outcomes without proper M&E

## Importance and Purpose of M&E

The sources strongly emphasize the **critical importance of M&E** for a variety of reasons:

1. **Facilitating Continuous Learning and Iteration**: Adaptation planning and implementation are viewed as **dynamic, iterative learning processes**. Regular monitoring and evaluation are required to carry out periodic adjustments as climatic and socioeconomic conditions change and knowledge of impacts increases. 

2. **Strengthening Planning and Implementation**: M&E can strengthen the role of planning as a societal tool for both Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and Disaster Risk Management (DRM). It plays an important role in helping to **adjust and revise adaptation implementation**, especially at the local scale.

3. **Transcending Fragmented Approaches**: Sustained monitoring, evaluation, and feedback are vital for initiatives like the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) to evolve from project-by-project efforts to a more comprehensive integration of adaptation with domestic and local development. Similarly, M&E can help early adaptation plans transcend from defensive but fragmented approaches to #multidimensional_policy_processes.

4. **Informing Decision-Making and Policy**: M&E helps to assess the effectiveness of strategies adopted and interventions undertaken, identifying what builds adaptive capacity and what functions as limits and barriers to adaptation. By expanding research on metrics for success and considering trade-offs and context, M&E can help avoid generalized assessments and provide specific insights into adaptation contributions.

5. **Ensuring Accountability and Transparency**: The institutionalization of M&E, as seen in the UK National Adaptation Programme with its scheduled assessments, underscores its role in ensuring progress and accountability towards adaptation objectives.

## Indicators and Metrics:

Specific examples include:
1. The **Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR)** defines five core indicators to measure outcomes at the country level, encompassing aspects like the number of people supported, integration of climate change in planning, use of improved tools, strengthened government capacity and coordination, and the development and testing of climate-responsive instruments, explicitly addressing gender issues.
    
2. **Nepal's National Framework on Local Adaptation Plans for Action (LAPAs)** emphasizes that monitoring and evaluation play key roles in supporting iterative planning, with financial arrangements being integrated into budget frameworks.

3. The **Albay Province in the Philippines** uses indicators to measure environmental improvements, infrastructure development plans, land development/conversion activities, and the institutionalization of pre-planning, enhanced implementation, and enhanced monitoring and evaluation.

4. The **UK National Adaptation Programme** uses #process-based markers (e.g., whether policies have been implemented) and quantitative data (e.g., statistics on trends in flood and water scarcity risks) as iterative progress indicators #result-based.
