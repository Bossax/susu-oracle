Designing a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system for Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) involves a structured process that requires specific decisions at each stage to ensure its effectiveness and relevance. The International Organization for Cooperation and Development of the Federal Republic of Germany (GIZ) provides guidance on developing such a national M&E system, emphasizing that it should be systematically developed by addressing fundamental issues.

Here are the detailed steps for designing an M&E system, including key decisions to make along the way:

### 1. Background Analysis (Step 1)

This initial step is crucial for ensuring the M&E framework aligns with the national policy context for CCA and for correctly identifying its objectives and subjects.

- **Decision: Define the policy context related to monitoring and evaluation.**
    - This involves analyzing the existing legal and policy foundations that necessitate the M&E framework.
    - You need to review current M&E activities for CCA in Viet Nam to inform the development plan.
    - _Key questions to consider include:_ How does the M&E framework fit within the broader policy context and other existing M&E frameworks?
    
- **Decision: Define the objectives of the M&E Framework.**
    - Clearly articulate what the M&E framework aims to achieve. Objectives can include:
        1. Monitoring the implementation of adaptation activities, such as legal document development, policy integration into plans, and adherence to adaptation solutions and projects.
        2. Assessing the effectiveness of adaptation activities in reducing vulnerability, enhancing adaptation capacity, and mitigating climate change damage.
        3. Contributing to increased awareness of adaptation throughout planning, implementation, and M&E processes.
    - Ultimately, the M&E framework aims to support the State management of CCA, assess effectiveness, and provide lessons learned.
    - _Key question to consider:_ What are the goals of the M&E Framework and how will its results be used?
    
- **Decision: Define the scope of the M&E Framework.**
    - Determine the extent of the monitoring and evaluation work, which dictates the scale of information collection and organization of implementation.
    - The scope can be:
        - **Nationwide**: Covering all sectors, fields, and provinces, reflecting the entire country's implementation and effectiveness. This is the scope for monitoring all CCA activities in the National Adaptation Plan (NAP).
        - **Sectoral**: Within a specific industry or field.
        - **Local**: For a province or city.
        - **Program/Project level**: While specific programs or projects have M&E, a broader "framework" typically doesn't exist at this level; rather, it's M&E _for_ the program/project.
    - _Key question to consider:_ How will the system be applied (national, local, or by area)?
- **Decision: Identify the subjects of the M&E Framework.**
    
    - Determine **who or what** is being monitored and evaluated. This includes the country's progress in CCA interventions, investments, and the planning and implementation of policies and plans.
    - Since climate change affects various areas like agriculture, water resources, and infrastructure across the nation, the subjects of M&E will encompass **all parties responsible for planning, formulating, and implementing CCA activities**. This includes ministries, ministerial-level agencies, and provincial-level People's Committees.
    - _Key question to consider:_ How is information collected and processed – bottom-up, by sector, or both?

### 2. Develop the Contents of the M&E Framework (Step 2)

This step focuses on defining what exactly will be monitored and how the necessary information will be gathered.

- **Decision: Determine the monitoring and evaluation focus.**
    
    - Decide whether the M&E will focus on the **process** (progress and level of implementation), the **results** (changes resulting from activities), or **both simultaneously**.
    - To achieve the objectives of the M&E Framework, it **must monitor and evaluate both the process and the results of adaptation activities**.
    - _Key question to consider:_ What does monitoring content need to consider: the process of activity implementation, adaptive solutions, or the results of actions and solutions?
- **Identify specific subjects of monitoring and evaluation.**
    
    - Based on the NAP contents (Decision No. 1055/QD-TTg), the M&E Framework should cover:
        - Updates on the development and implementation of adaptation policies and mechanisms, and the integration of CCA content into various plans and strategies.
        - Results of activities aimed at increasing resilience and CCA capacity.
        - Activities and results in natural disaster prevention, control, and mitigation.
        - Results of CCA-targeted investment projects.
        - Scientific research and international cooperation for CCA.
        - Communication and awareness-raising activities for CCA.
- **Decision: Identify monitoring and evaluation indicators.**
    
    - Indicators are developed after defining the background, scope, subjects, and focus of M&E.
    - Indicators should follow the **SMART** rule:
        - **S**pecific: Developed accurately and without ambiguity.
        - **M**easurable: Quantifiable.
        - **A**greed: Accepted by stakeholders.
        - **R**elevant: Describe underlying issues and are eligible for prevention/control.
        - **T**ime-bound: Have a temporary time reference.
    - The proposed M&E Framework includes 72 indicators across various activities like State management, strengthened resilience, natural disaster risk reduction, resources for CCA, science/technology/international cooperation, and training/communication.
- **Decision: Determine requirements for information and data collection.**
    
    - **At the provincial level**: Information and data are collected and aggregated from lower levels (district and commune), including community CCA activities, in a **vertical collection model**. Data is also collected and aggregated from various provincial departments and sectors (e.g., agriculture, environment) in a **horizontal data collection model**. Therefore, at the provincial level, data collection is carried out both vertically and horizontally.
    - **At the national level**: Information is collected and aggregated **vertically from provinces** and **horizontally from ministries and sectors**. Key ministries involved include MARD, MONRE, MOIT, MOT, MOC, MOH, MOLISA, MCST for field-specific data, and MPI, MOF, MOST for policy, investment, and science/technology data.
    - _Key question to consider:_ What kind of information and data need to be collected to achieve the M&E framework's goals?

### 3. Operation of the M&E Framework (Step 3)

This step defines how the M&E framework will be implemented and managed institutionally.

- **Decision: Establish the M&E implementation mechanism.**
    
    - Ideally, a dedicated Coordination Committee with qualified staff would be formed at central, ministerial, and provincial levels.
    - However, considering administrative reform policies to avoid increasing focal points, the M&E activities should be integrated into existing organizations. These include:
        - **MONRE**: The national focal agency, assisting the National Committee on Climate Change (NCCC) and the Government in guiding, coordinating, supervising, monitoring, and evaluating nationwide adaptation activities. The Department of Climate Change (DCC), which houses the Office of the NCCC, supports MONRE in this role.
        - **Focal point/agency on CC in each ministry/sector**: Assists their respective Minister in deploying, monitoring, and evaluating adaptation activities within their scope, reporting to MONRE. They also coordinate with national and other ministerial focal agencies.
        - **Provincial DONRE (Department of Natural Resources and Environment)**: Assists the Provincial People's Committees (PPCs) in deploying, supervising, monitoring, and evaluating adaptation activities within the province, reporting to MONRE. At the district level, the District Division of Natural Resources and Environment assists the district People's Committee.
    - This organizational structure illustrates the direction, collaboration, and reporting flow within the National M&E Framework.
    - _Key question to consider:_ How is the organizational structure utilized and what resources are necessary?
- **Decision: Assign agencies in charge of M&E.**
    
    - **At the provincial level**: DONRE is the focal point, coordinating with other departments and district People's Committees (DPCs). PPCs need to issue regulations on coordination and responsibilities.
    - **Ministries and sectors**: Through their CC focal agencies, they monitor and evaluate adaptation policies, plans, tasks, and projects within their scope. They coordinate with management agencies and subordinate units for data collection and information synthesis. They also need to develop internal coordination regulations.
    - **Department of Climate Change (DCC) under MONRE**: Assists the Minister of MONRE as the National focal agency. It collects M&E information from ministries, sectors, and provinces to summarize and evaluate overall national adaptation efforts. The DCC also coordinates internally within MONRE for its own adaptation activities.
- **Decision: Establish mechanisms for information summary and evaluation.**
    
    - **Provincial level**: M&E is conducted by the assigned agency (usually DONRE), coordinating with local departments to collect information based on M&E indicators. Reports are submitted to the local government for approval, then sent to MONRE.
    - **Ministerial and sectoral levels**: The climate change focal agency in each ministry/sector synthesizes and evaluates their respective CCA activities, gathering information from managed fields, programs, plans, and projects. Assessment reports are sent to MONRE.
    - **National level**: MONRE, with direct assistance from the DCC (Office of the NCCC), monitors and evaluates national CCA activities. Information is aggregated from provincial, ministerial, and sectoral reports, as well as MONRE's own directly managed plans and projects. National M&E reports are submitted to climate change management levels and the Prime Minister.
    - _Key question to consider:_ How are necessary information and data collected and processed?

### 4. Products of the M&E Framework (Step 4)

This final step defines the outputs generated by the M&E system.

- **Define the main products.**
    
    - The primary products are **annual overall M&E reports on CCA activities**.
    - Ministries, sectors, and provinces prepare and submit their reports to MONRE by a specified time.
    - MONRE synthesizes these reports for the Government annually, allowing for adjustments and supplements if necessary. This national report also serves as the Country Report on Climate Change for submission to the UNFCCC Secretariat.
- **Software and Database Design.**
    
    - An **online M&E database** should be developed and operated, ensuring information security. Its purpose is to unify information for M&E activities related to climate change strategies, master plans, and development plans.
    - The software should allow ministries, agencies, and PPCs to **declare and report M&E data online**, and enable management ministries to receive, statisticalize, edit, and manage reports easily and quickly.
    - Requirements for the software include adherence to M&E framework indicators and report templates, a user-friendly interface, separation of content by scope of management, and easy editing and report generation.
    - _Key question to consider:_ What is the product of the M&E Framework?

In essence, designing an M&E system for climate change adaptation is like building a comprehensive health tracking system for a vast forest. You first decide what aspects of the forest's health you want to monitor (objectives and scope), which entities are responsible for the forest's well-being (subjects), and what factors indicate health or decline (indicators). Then, you set up a network of sensors and human observers to collect data (information collection), and establish a clear chain of command for how this data flows up to the central forest management (implementation mechanism and agencies). Finally, all this data is compiled into regular reports, like a forest health report card, to inform future decisions and adjust conservation efforts (products and updates).
