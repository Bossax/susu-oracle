## 2.1 Interpretation of Objective

This assignment is to deliver a compliant, coherent, and decision-useful Adaptation Chapter for Thailand’s combined 5NC/2BTR, aligned with UNFCCC transparency requirements and anchored in national policy and institutional realities. It requires an up-to-date, evidence-based narrative that addresses climate impacts, risks and vulnerabilities, priorities and barriers, strategies and actions, implementation progress, monitoring and evaluation, loss and damage, and cooperation and lessons, while ensuring internal consistency with other BTR chapters and coherence with the NAP and NDC. The assignment is not only a reporting task; it is also intended to clarify and strengthen Thailand’s national cycle for implementing, monitoring, evaluating, and reporting adaptation so that transparent, comparable submissions become routine and sustainable across cycles.

Thailand’s adaptation architecture has advanced meaningfully. The National Adaptation Plan (revised in 2024) provides strategic direction across sectors and governance levels; an initial stocktake has begun to consolidate insights on progress in key sectors; and a national spatial climate risk map has established a common reference for risk-informed prioritization, with an improved version under development to enhance coverage and decision-relevance. For the purpose of this assignment, three issues are material: ensuring coherence of adaptation content across instruments and chapters (shared definitions, baselines, and figures); improving the usability of climate risk information at sub-provincial levels for both decision-making and periodic reporting; and operationalizing a practical adaptation M&E approach with clear objectives, SMART indicators and baselines, defined institutional roles and data flows, and fit-for-purpose QA/QC and validation.

Internationally, adaptation reporting has evolved from descriptive narratives in NCs to a more structured transparency regime under the Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework. For Thailand, this means the Adaptation Chapter should follow the agreed reporting elements, demonstrate alignment with national instruments, and be supported by information and M&E foundations that the country can maintain over time. The UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience provides globally agreed targets and an emerging indicator logic to operationalize the Global Goal on Adaptation; where relevant and feasible, the chapter will reflect these insights through existing reporting channels without adding burden, and in a manner that remains flexible to the evolution of indicators under the UAE–Belém work programme.

Success at the end of this assignment will be defined by four outcomes. First, a UNFCCC-compliant Adaptation Chapter that is complete, internally consistent, and clearly situated in Thailand’s policy and institutional context. Second, a clarified national adaptation implementation and reporting cycle that specifies who does what, when, and with what data, designed for continuity across reporting periods. Third, a usable and standardized climate risk information foundation suitable for district-level analysis nationwide (and subdistrict where available), enabling more consistent and comparable reporting. Fourth, a baseline M&E framework and data reference sheet that Thailand can use to track adaptation progress consistently across sectors and over time, with attention to gender and social inclusion, and ability to incorporate relevant global indicators as they mature.

This interpretation is guided by core principles: compliance with UNFCCC transparency requirements; country-driven alignment with the NAP and NDC; coherence across national instruments and BTR chapters; evidence-based, gender-responsive, and socially inclusive approaches; data protection and institutional sustainability; and practical usefulness for policy and planning. It assumes timely access to multi-agency data, agreement on institutional roles and validation processes, adherence to national IT and security standards, and stakeholder availability for review and endorsement.


## 2.2 Proposed Technical Concept and Approach

2.2.1 Conceptual Foundation

The work of this project is to strengthen Thailand’s climate change adaptation by building on what already exists and functions. Thailand has made meaningful advances in many areas of the adaptation ecosystem. Regarding, Impact, Vulnerability, and Risk assessment, the Spatial Climate Risk Map version 1 that was released in 2022, has been central to climate policy dialogues. The second version is being developed and close to finalization. The National Adaptation Plan which is a written document of high-level strategy for climate adaptation planning was updated and submitted to the UNFCCC in 2024.  The new NAP has Governance structure of climate change adaptation has become active and made significance advances. The NAP coordinating mechanism through the ministerial focal points of the six NAP adaptation sectors — Water Resources; Agriculture and Food Security; Tourism; Natural Resources Management; Public Health; and Human Settlement and Security — was  exercised and resulted in a success of the first Adaptation Chapter reporting in BTR 1 in 2024. These activities demonstrate the dynamic of climate change adaptation ecosystem which is crucial for the success and effectiveness of this project.

In parallel to the progress in the climate change adaptation, the Thai government has been constantly driving the improvement on the processes of state administration. Key processes relevant to this project are budgeting, monitoring and evaluation of line agency's performance, and digitalization of public information, for example. These processes are managed by specific government agencies and also highly dynamic. The execution of this project is made sure to take the context into consideration.   

We position the Adaptation Chapter assignment to consolidate the patchwork into a coherent report that comprehensively depicts the recent progress toward climate resilience. 

Our approach is three principles.
1. Compliance and Coherence:
	The content in all  UNFCCC reporting instruments will be considered to ensure coherence of country's communication
	MGPs will guide the compilation of the content of the Adaptation Chapter 
	The UAE FGCR will guide data collection design process and the design of the adaptation M&E framework


2. Scale of relevance:
	The scale of focus is a crucial factor to make the information relevant to the context and the need of the country.
	Reporting contain information at national, sectoral, and regional  but the main focus is the sectoral level.
	The adaptation M&E system will focus on the sectoral level monitoring, evaluation and learning. 
	Due to the foundational importance of climate risk information, the scales of relevance of this task will be smaller than. The more granular risk information will pave  the way for a better planning, implementation, and evluation of adaptation measure profile. Therefore, the focus of the climate risk information service and infrastructure in this project will be providing information at the district and sub-district level.  


3. Sustainability
	the outputs of this assignment (e.g., annotated chapter outline, stocktake synthesis, baseline M&E structures, and indicator references) should be maintainable by Thai institutions and compatible with evolving global guidance, including the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience. 

This section sets the concept and approach logic. The detailed execution sequence, tools, QA/QC and risk management arrangements, Gantt schedule, and governance specifics are presented in dedicated sections of the proposal.

2.2.2 Task-Level Approaches

This assignment will produce five  technical outputs that directly respond to the TOR and feed the 5NC/2BTR Adaptation Chapter
1. Climate Change Adaptation Cycle tailored to Thailand’s administrative context
2. Comprehensive stocktaking report on NAP implementation progress (to end‑2024) across the six priority sectors
3. Adaptation monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework including a conceptual M&E process structure, a conceptual baseline framework, linkages to broader national systems, sectoral data collection tools, and reporting requirements
4. Prototype of an M&E indicator toolbox comprising a long list of spatially explicit indicators, a supporting data structure, prioritized indicator methodologies, and a  Data Reference Sheet
5. Adaptation Chapter for the 5NC/2BTR. 

These outputs are generated through three four tasks and are sequenced to satisfy immediate reporting needs while strengthening national systems for subsequent cycles. The detailed methodology, tools, and oversight modalities are provided in the  Methodology section.

### Task 1: Review of existing Thailand’s climate change adaptation information and the progress of NAP implementation (up to 2024)

Task 1 establishes the base for the Adaptation Chapter and the subsequent tasks. It begins with a desk review of UNFCCC transparency guidance (with attention to adaptation reporting elements); Thailand’s NAP (2024 revision), NDC, 4th National Communication (4NC), 3rd Biennial Update Report (3BUR), 1st Biennial Transparency Report (1BTR), and sectoral adaptation plans and documentation. This review synthesizes how adaptation has been framed, implemented, and monitored across the six NAP sectors and identifies gaps or inconsistencies that matter for transparent reporting and the future operational adaptation cycle.

An early focus is indicator clarity and alignment. Existing NAP and NDC indicators will be organized, clarified, and compared to internationally evolving guidance—specifically the GGA-FGCR thematic areas and the Adaptation Cycle stages. The intent is to identify which indicators are already used by the Thai administrative system and can be used to represent evidence in adaptation progress, and where practical enhancements (definitions, baselines, spatial disaggregation) would most improve comparability and decision-usefulness for future cycles.

We will propose a national Adaptation Cycle that situates adaptation planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting within key Thai administrative processes; namely, budgeting, strategic planning, and the annual performance evaluation cycles of government agencies. This mapping clarifies “who does what, when, and with what data” and reveals leverage points to institutionalize adaptation monitoring, evaluation, and reporting. A stakeholder engagement process with DCCE and sector focal points will be used to validate the cycle’s fit with actual practices.

In parallel, we will conduct stakeholder mapping to identify focal agencies and data custodians who are relevant in the adaptation implementation of NAP sectors. In addition, another key group of stakeholders are the agencies who dictate the rules of governmental performance evaluation. Through semi‑structured discussions, we will confirm current practices for data collection (project, agency, and sector levels) and performance evaluation, clarify indicator definitions and data flows, and validate preliminary findings about NAP progress and coherence issues. To support these engagements, we will prepare concise data collection templates and interview guides aligned with UNFCCC adaptation reporting expectations and with the FGCR’s guidance logic where relevant.

Throughout Task 1, regular progress meetings with DCCE will ensure alignment, facilitate early validation, and support timely resolution of open issues. Detailed tools, templates, and sequencing are provided in the Methodology section.


Task 2 deliverables will be led by our partner. For coherence and to minimize rework, our tasks assume: (a) nationwide district-level coverage (and subdistrict where available) for hazard and exposure layers; (b) standardized exchange formats so indicator computations and map products align with the partner’s data structures; and (c) scheduled alignment touchpoints so the stocktake synthesis, indicator toolbox, and Adaptation Chapter remain consistent with the platform’s final data content. We will coordinate closely to ensure that the Adaptation Chapter references authoritative, validated layers and that indicator definitions remain consistent with the platform’s schema. Detailed methods and specifications for Task 2 are presented in the partner’s section of the proposal.

### Task 3: Development of baseline framework and its data reference sheet to support the operations of a spatial M&E system of climate change impacts in vulnerable areas

We structure the approach to this task into 3-step approach

#### Step 1: Policy context and M&E needs. 

We will inventory existing M&E mechanisms and processes relevant to adaptation, including those embedded in national budgeting, strategic planning, NDC tracking, and SDG monitoring. Through desk review and interviews with the stakeholders mapped out under Task 1, we will identify where adaptation M&E can be integrated with existing processes to minimize burden and maximize institutional fit. We will capture stakeholder perspectives on challenges encountered in adaptation M&E—both for internationally funded projects and nationally budgeted initiatives—to ground the framework in practicality. Process mapping will clarify current data collection, aggregation, verification, and reporting pathways in all relevant administrative and governance cycles. The result will highlight assets to reuse and gaps that the adaptation M&E framework needs to solve.

### Step 2: Development of the M&E framework content
We will define the conceptual baseline framework for adaptation M&E, then compile a long list of spatially explicit indicators spanning risks, impacts, vulnerabilities (exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity), and adaptation actions relevant to **sector-level evaluation**. From this long list, and based on data availability and sectoral relevance, we will establish a prioritized set with clear definitions, calculation methodologies, and units. Using these, we will produce a demonstration Data Reference Sheet with baseline values for selected indicators, accompanied by essential metadata (source, vintage, method, and any limitations). This provides a tangible starting point for routine tracking.

### Step 3: Demonstration and refinement. 
We will demonstrate how the baseline framework can be applied to create an M&E product, Data Reference Sheet, and illustrate its intended workflow through a case example. We will then convene a communication session with relevant agencies to present the framework and demonstration sheet, gather expert feedback, and incorporate refinements. The resulting outputs—baseline framework, indicator set, Data Reference Sheet (demonstration version), and a concise Data Reference Sheet design guideline—will feed the 5NC/2BTR Adaptation Chapter’s sections on progress and M&E and establish a maintainable foundation for future cycles. T

### Task 4: A chapter containing all information related to climate change impacts and adaptation is written in the 5NC/2BTR (up to 2024)

Task 4 transforms the evidence from Tasks 1 and 3 (and aligned Task 2 outputs) into a complete, coherent, and stakeholder‑validated Adaptation Chapter for the 5NC/2BTR. Drafting will follow the annotated outline developed under Task 1 and will fully address the agreed UNFCCC adaptation reporting elements, including national circumstances and institutional/legal arrangements; impacts, risks, and vulnerabilities; priorities and barriers; strategies, policies, plans, goals and actions; progress on implementation; monitoring and evaluation; information related to loss and damage; and cooperation, good practices, experiences, and lessons learned. Each section will cite its evidence source and maintain consistency with the BTR’s other chapters and with national instruments (NAP/NDC).

A two‑stage validation process will ensure quality and ownership. First, the draft chapter will be circulated to key agencies and stakeholders for written feedback. Second, a national stakeholder validation workshop will be convened and co‑facilitated to review key findings and confirm the chapter’s completeness and coherence. Following consolidation of feedback, the chapter will be revised, edited, and prepared for submission to DCCE and UNDP as the finalized Adaptation Chapter for inclusion in Thailand’s 5NC/2BTR. The Methodology section details drafting workflows and version control; the QA/QC section covers validation and sign‑off arrangements; and the Gantt presents the schedule.
