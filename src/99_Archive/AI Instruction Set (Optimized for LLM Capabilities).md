### Purpose

Transform a **technical proposal** into a **draft inception report** that is operational, logically structured, and ready for expert polishing.

### 1. Overall Objective

Produce a complete inception report draft that:

- Confirms shared understanding of objectives and deliverables.
    
- Details the approach, methods, and coordination plan.
    
- Presents a realistic work plan and QA structure.
    
- Avoids promotional tone or capability claims.
    

LLM should **focus on clarity, logical flow, and technical completeness**, while **leaving layout, formatting, and institutional tone refinement to the human editor.**

---

### 2. Document Structure to Generate

The AI must produce a full-text inception report with the following sections:

1. **Executive Summary** – Purpose, scope, timeline, deliverables, methodology summary.
    
2. **Chapter 1: Concept and Implementation Plan**
    
    - 1.1 Objective
        
    - 1.2 Technical Concept, Approach, and Methodology
        
    - 1.3 Conceptual Foundation (integration with client systems)
        
    - 1.4 Task-Specific Approach (Tasks 1–4)
        
    - 1.5 Workplan (narrative + structured timeline)
        
    - 1.6 Deliverables (numbered with descriptions and dates)
        
    - 1.7 Governance, Quality Assurance, and Risk Management
        
3. **References**
    
4. **Appendices (summarized)**
    

AI must not attempt to:

- Create visual tables or Gantt charts (describe instead).
    
- Generate figures or diagrams.
    
- Format tables, numbering, or metadata precisely.
    
- Produce institutional headers or cover pages.

### 3. Content and Tone Rules

|Objective|Rule|
|---|---|
|Tone|Use neutral, institutional phrasing. Avoid persuasive or self-referential language.|
|Pronouns|Use “the project” or “the assignment” instead of “we.”|
|Tense|Use present or near-future tense for ongoing work.|
|References|Describe source material but avoid fake citations.|
|Technical specificity|Include tools, data systems, and workflows clearly.|
|QA & Risks|Include structured risk logic and mitigation actions.|

---

### 4. Logical Integration Between Tasks

- State dependencies explicitly: e.g., “Outputs from Task 1 will inform Task 3 framework design.”
    
- Mention feedback and validation points where relevant.
    
- Link each deliverable to its task and timing.
    

---

### 5. Timeline and Deliverables

- Convert “Month X–Y” to calendar months if the proposal provides start date.
    
- Describe deliverables in list form (D1–D5) with due dates and review process.
    

---

### 6. Validation and QA

Include standard subsections describing:

- Validation flow (draft → consultation → incorporation → final sign-off)
    
- QA/QC approach for writing, data, and software components
    
- Risk identification and mitigation strategies
    

---

### 7. What Not to Do

- Do **not** replicate proposal marketing or capability text.
    
- Do **not** include CVs, company credentials, or annexes unrelated to execution.
    
- Do **not** invent data, deliverables, or figures not supported by the proposal.
    

---

### 8. Quality Self-Check (for AI)

Before finalizing the draft, verify that:

- Each section is present and titled correctly.
    
- Deliverables have descriptions and due dates.
    
- Dependencies between tasks are described.
    
- QA, governance, and risks are included.
    
- No persuasive or promotional text remains.
