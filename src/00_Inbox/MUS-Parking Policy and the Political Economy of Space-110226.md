# MUS-The Parking Paradox-February 11, 2026

The lecture begins not with the roar of traffic, but with a recovery—a technical glitch resolved, a microphone adjusted, and a room settling into the rhythm of a Tuesday afternoon. The lecturer, Apiwat, is in a mood that oscillates between Socratic provocation and cynical realism. He opens with a tangent, as he often does, grounding the abstract theories of urban planning in the messy reality of human behavior.

"Thailand is safe," he muses, perhaps referencing a recovered item or a general observation of the room. "But don't test it too often. Eventually, you will lose it."

This segues into a story about a former colleague, an anthropologist described charitably by Apiwat as "an idiot" who moved to Pennsylvania. This colleague once conducted a social experiment involving envelopes. The test was simple: drop an envelope with a stamp and an address in random places around the world and see if strangers would pick it up and mail it. It was a test of civic altruism. Apiwat’s takeaway for his students in Bangkok is less about the data and more about street smarts: "Don't test that with your valuables."

It is a fitting prologue for a session dedicated to **Parking**, a subject that sits at the uncomfortable intersection of human selfishness, spatial economics, and public policy. Parking is not merely about where a car stops; it is, as the next three hours will reveal, a battleground for equity, a distortion of real estate markets, and perhaps the single most emotional trigger in the urban experience.

### Part I: The Curb and the Cruiser

The session opens with student presentations, laying the groundwork for the theoretical dissection to follow. The first presenter tackles the fundamental dichotomy of the stationary vehicle: **On-street versus Off-street parking**.

The presentation highlights a phenomenon that plagues every major metropolis: "Cruising." The student notes that when curb parking is underpriced or free, drivers will circle the block indefinitely, hunting for a spot like sharks in shallow water. This "cruising" is not just a nuisance; it is a significant contributor to congestion and pollution. The data presented suggests that in some dense urban cores, up to 34% of traffic is simply people looking for parking, with search times averaging between 3.5 to 14 minutes.

The student proposes that the solution lies in **Off-street parking** (garages, lots) to clear the roads for movement, and **Park-and-Ride** facilities to intercept commuters before they enter the Central Business District (CBD). However, the student astutely notes an "abstraction effect"—where park-and-ride facilities might inadvertently encourage people who previously took public transit from home to drive part of the way, thereby increasing car dependency in the suburbs.

The second presenter, Teresa, shifts the focus to technology and informality. She examines **Singapore’s "Parking.sg" app**, a digital solution that allows drivers to pay per minute, reducing the friction of transaction and the need for physical coupons. She contrasts this with the **London Virtual Loading Bays**, a system designed to manage the chaos of delivery logistics. But her most compelling case study comes from Indonesia, focusing on the _Jukir_—the informal, often illegal, parking attendants who control street space. These figures, operating in the grey zone of legality, extract revenue that the state misses, creating a complex web of local power dynamics where "protection" and "service" blur.

### Part II: The Empty Road and the Pareto Efficiency

Here, Apiwat steps in. He is not interested in merely nodding at the slides; he wants to dismantle the assumptions behind them. He seizes on the concept of **Dynamic Pricing** and the economic rationale for allowing cars to park on the street at all.

"So," Apiwat asks, scanning the room, "Why is it okay to allow people to park on the street during the day?"

He pushes the students to think beyond the obvious. If a road like Phaya Thai is empty during non-peak hours, why shouldn't cars be allowed to store themselves there? He introduces the concept of **Pareto Efficiency**.

"Pareto Efficiency," he explains, spelling it out for emphasis, "is a state where you gain benefit without having another person losing utility."

If the road is empty (sunk cost), and a car parks there, the driver gains utility (convenience), local businesses gain utility (access), and the moving traffic loses nothing because the lane was unused anyway. In the vacuum of economic theory, this is efficient. But Apiwat plays the Devil’s Advocate. "If the road is empty, why not allow it?"

The class hesitates. They sense a trap. Someone mentions that police wouldn't allow it. Apiwat dismisses this as contextual—rules change based on the road. The deeper issue is **Institutionalization**. By allowing parking when it is efficient, you build a habit. Drivers begin to view the public right-of-way as a private storage facility. The "efficiency" of the moment creates a "right" that is nearly impossible to revoke later.

> **Lecturer’s Expansion: The Trap of Pareto in Urban Planning**
> 
> _While Apiwat uses Pareto Efficiency to explain the logic of on-street parking, it is crucial to understand why this economic concept often fails in complex urban systems. Pareto Efficiency is a static measure—it looks at a single moment in time. It asks: "Right now, is anyone worse off?"_
> 
> _However, cities are dynamic, adaptive systems. When a city designates a lane for parking because "it’s empty right now," they are not just allocating space; they are inducing demand. This is where the concept of **Path Dependence** enters the fray. Once a curb is designated for parking, the local economy organizes around it. Shops replace delivery zones with customer parking expectations; drivers purchase larger vehicles assuming storage is available. To remove that parking later—even if the lane is desperately needed for a bus rapid transit (BRT) line or a bike lane—becomes a political impossibility because the "losers" (the drivers and shop owners) are now identified and vocal, whereas the "winners" (future bus riders) remain hypothetical._
> 
> _Furthermore, Pareto Efficiency ignores **Equity**. A policy can be Pareto Efficient while being grostesquely unfair. If a billionaire buys the only parking spot in a public park for $1 million, and the city uses that money to plant trees, an economist might argue this is efficient (the billionaire is happy, the city has revenue). But the public has lost access to a democratic resource. In urban mobility, relying solely on efficiency metrics often obscures the systematic exclusion of non-drivers._

### Part III: The Taylor Swift Problem (Equity vs. The Market)

The conversation shifts inevitably to money. If we are going to allow parking, how do we price it? The class discusses **Dynamic Pricing**—charging more when demand is high. San Francisco is cited, where sensors adjust meter rates to target 85% occupancy, ensuring one or two spots are always open.

But the discussion takes a sharp turn toward morality when a student, Maya, raises the issue of "Ability to Pay."

"People who drive Ferraris should pay more than people who drive Tuk-tuks," the argument goes.

Apiwat latches onto this. "Is there something related to morality here?" he asks. "Can they overcharge? Like Taylor Swift's concert?"

He invokes the "Swifties" and the astronomical resale prices of concert tickets. Is a parking spot a basic human right? Or is it a commodity like a concert ticket? If we allow the market to dictate the price of parking through bidding (as San Francisco experimented with), the logical conclusion is that the rich will always secure the best spots.

"If you let that be a market," Apiwat warns, "then whoever gets to pay the most will be able to get that spot all the time."

He references **Michael Sandel**, the Harvard philosopher and author of _What Money Can't Buy_. Sandel argues that there are moral limits to markets—that putting a price on certain things (like human organs, or perhaps public access) corrupts their value.

Apiwat challenges the "socialist" leanings of the class. Maya argues for a tiered system where the poor pay less. Apiwat pushes back with brutal economic logic: A Tesla and an old, polluting Tuk-tuk occupy the same physical space (approx. 12-15 square meters). In fact, the Tuk-tuk pollutes _more_.

"Why are we charging the rich more even though the car... occupies the same space?" he asks. "The Tesla people can come and say, 'Why am I paying more? I'm helping the economy. I'm helping the environment.'"

The class struggles with this. They want a "Just Transition"—a way to move to a green economy without punishing the poor who rely on old vehicles. But Apiwat reminds them that parking is, at its core, an **allocation of limited space**. Currently, we use "First Come, First Served." It is a democratic, if inefficient, queue. Dynamic pricing introduces efficiency but sacrifices equity. There is no perfect answer, only a choice between waiting in line or paying a premium.

> **Lecturer’s Expansion: The Ethics of Commodification**
> 
> _The debate Apiwat stirs up touches on the fundamental tension between **Commoditization** and **Public Goods**. When we treat street parking as a commodity (highest bidder wins), we are implicitly saying that public space is a luxury good. This leads to the **Gentrification of Access**. In cities like London or Singapore, congestion charging and high parking fees have effectively cleared the roads—but mostly for those who can afford it. The "efficiency" gained is the removal of the working class from the road network._
> 
> _Conversely, treating parking as a "Right" (free or cheap for all) leads to the **Tragedy of the Commons**, represented here by cruising and congestion. A potential middle ground often discussed in sustainable mobility circles is **Feebates** or progressive taxation at the point of vehicle purchase, rather than the point of parking. If the rich pay significantly more to register a Ferrari, that revenue can subsidize public transit, making the need for parking less critical for lower-income groups. However, Apiwat’s critique holds: once the car is on the road, the space it occupies is absolute. Physics does not offer a discount for poverty._

### Part IV: The Doll, The Chair, and The Lived Experience

From the high towers of economic theory, Apiwat drags the class back down to the chaotic streets of Bangkok. He asks about the items people use to reserve parking spots in front of their homes—an illegal practice that is culturally codified.

"I’ve once seen... an old freaking doll," Apiwat recounts, laughing at the absurdity. "Like an old teddy bear, but torn apart... Who the hell hold you there? But hey, it's freaking... it's pretty freaking scary."

He paints a vivid picture: tires, chairs, buckets of cement, and mutilated dolls guarding the curb. This is the **Privatization of the Public Realm** by residents. Legally, the street belongs to everyone. Ideally, a visitor should be able to park in front of a shop house. But in practice, the resident feels a sense of ownership.

Apiwat introduces the concept of **Residential Parking Permits** as the technocratic solution. Residents pay a fee to the city for the exclusive right to park in their zone. It formalizes the claim. But he asks the class to consider the counter-argument.

"Why would we prioritize the residents?" he asks.

A student suggests that residents have a "sense of ownership" and will take care of the space. Apiwat nods, validating this with an observation from his own commute. He walks past an empty lot awaiting "Marriott Gentrification." Because it is empty and unclaimed, it is covered in trash. Just down the street, a motorcycle taxi stand is spotless because the drivers sweep it. They have claimed the space; therefore, they steward it.

However, the counter-argument is fierce. Prioritizing residents—especially in wealthy areas like Central Paris or Sukhumvit—essentially subsidizes the rich. "If they can buy townhouses in central New York... they're not poor," Apiwat argues. "By favoring them, you're even enforcing the idea that rich people could get away with... privileges."

### Part V: The Hong Kong Dating Scene (Capitalization)

Moving from the street to the structure, the lecture addresses **Off-Street Parking** and the economics of **Capitalization**.

Apiwat explains that as land values rise, development must go vertical to capture value. This applies to parking as much as housing. He shares a personal anecdote about visiting Hong Kong and noticing the abundance of luxury cars.

"I was always wondering why people drive only expensive cars... You don't see cheap cars in Hong Kong generally. It's because of parking."

In Hong Kong, the cost of housing a car is so prohibitive that only the ultra-wealthy can afford it. There are specialized real estate agents solely for parking spots. Apiwat offers a piece of cynical dating advice to the class:

"If you have a friend coming from Hong Kong... don't ask about the car. Ask whether they have a parking lot. That's wealth automatically... Before going out on a date with a Hong Kong person, don't ask for a ring... ask, 'Do you have a parking lot?'"

This is **Signaling Theory** in action. The parking spot is a truer indicator of economic status than the vehicle itself.

### Part VI: The Japanese Barrier (Proof of Parking)

If Hong Kong manages parking through market pricing, Japan manages it through bureaucracy. Apiwat brings up the _Shako Shomeisho_—the **Certificate of Parking**. In Japan, you cannot register a car unless you prove to the police that you have an off-street space to store it.

"Why don't we have that regulation in Bangkok or in Thailand?" he asks.

A student from Manila notes that they also have "plenty of space" (sarcastically) or informal spaces, so people just buy cars. Apiwat digs deeper. The issue is not just space; it is **Elasticity** and **Enforcement Costs**.

In a city with a sprawling, unmanageable layout like Manila or Bangkok, enforcing a proof-of-parking law would require a massive bureaucratic apparatus. Furthermore, driving in these cities is **inelastic**—people feel they _need_ to drive because public transport is insufficient.

"If you tell people to find a parking lot space... it would just add more work to the driver," Apiwat notes. It wouldn't stop them from driving; it would just make them miserable and likely increase corruption (bribing for certificates). In Japan, the alternative (trains) is so good that the regulation works. In Thailand, it would likely just be another "cost" passed onto the consumer without changing behavior.

> **[Lecturer’s Expansion: The Policy Transfer Fallacy]**
> 
> _This section highlights a critical failure in urban planning education: the **Cut-and-Paste** mentality. Planners often look at Tokyo’s parking laws or Copenhagen’s bike lanes and assume they can be dropped into Jakarta or Bangkok. Apiwat is using the "Proof of Parking" example to illustrate **Contextual Dependency**._
> 
> _A policy like _Shako Shomeisho_ relies on three pillars: 1) A highly efficient alternative (rail), 2) A culture of compliance/strict enforcement, and 3) A land market that functions transparently. If you introduce this law in a city with weak governance, you create a black market for fake parking certificates. If you introduce it in a city with no transit, you destroy the economic mobility of the working class who need vans or trucks for their livelihoods. Sustainable mobility is not just about "banning bad things"; it is about the ecosystem in which those regulations live._

### Part VII: The Condo Paradox and the "Missing Middle"

The lecture culminates in a discussion of **Minimum Parking Requirements**—the zoning laws that mandate every new building provide a certain number of parking spots.

Historically, this was done to prevent "spillover"—to stop new residents from clogging up the street parking. It was an attempt to **internalize the externality**. But Apiwat explains why modern planners hate it: it makes housing expensive.

"If your condo is only one million Baht and the cost of providing parking is 300,000... reducing parking requirements would help developers... reduce the cost of housing."

He discusses the push for **Maximum Parking Requirements** (capping the number of spots) or removing requirements entirely near Transit-Oriented Developments (TOD).

However, Apiwat reveals a startling finding from his own research, a paper he co-authored analyzing Bangkok condos. The logical assumption is that condos near the BTS (Skytrain) or in the city center should have _less_ parking because residents can walk or take the train.

"Our analysis... showed that the closer a project... is to the city center, the more parking there is. And the closer you are to the BTS... the more parking they provide."

It is a paradox. **The closer to transit, the more cars.**

Why? Because land near the station is expensive. Therefore, the condos built there are luxury units ("20 million Baht up"). The people who buy these units are wealthy. Wealthy people own cars, often multiple cars, even if they live on top of a train station.

"The developer thinks... 'My clients are rich, they're not going to take the BTS... so I have to provide more parking spaces.'"

This destroys the dream of TOD in Bangkok. We are not building transit-oriented communities; we are building vertical parking garages for the wealthy who happen to live near a train they don't use.

### Part VIII: The Psychological Toll and the 7-Eleven Tourist

As the clock winds down, Apiwat touches on the psychology of the driver. He mentions the visceral difference between being stuck in traffic (resignation, listening to music) versus hunting for parking (agitation, anxiety).

"The feeling of getting stuck in the traffic and the feeling of looking for space... It's so wasteful," he says.

He diverges briefly to mention the phenomenon of **7-Elevens** becoming tourist attractions, specifically for Filipino tourists buying cosmetic packets to share on TikTok. "I don't know what they are," he admits, but the point is about turnover. In a 7-Eleven, you want customers to park, buy, and leave (10 minutes). You don't want them camping out. This dictates the pricing model: short-term cheap, long-term expensive.

He concludes with a grim look at enforcement. In other cities, illegal parking is solved by **Towing**. It is a predatory, efficient private business.

"I would get into the towing business," Apiwat jokes (or perhaps doesn't). But in Thailand, we lack the legal framework and the towing capacity. So, people park, pay the occasional 200 Baht fine (which is cheaper than a day in a garage), and the chaos continues.

### Conclusion: The Unwinnable War

The lecture ends with a warning about **Supply-Side Solutions**. You cannot build your way out of a parking problem.

"First, you provide parking. Then everybody buys a car. Everybody drives and you will have limited space for parking again," Apiwat summarizes. This is **Induced Demand**.

He tells the story of a mayor in the US who tried to introduce parking meters in a town where parking had always been free. He lost the next election.

"People hate when the thing that they feel like is their right is taken away."

And that is the parking paradox. It is technically a privilege, economically a commodity, but psychologically a right. To solve it requires not just sensors and apps, but a fundamental rewiring of the urban contract—a task that makes dropping envelopes in Pennsylvania seem easy by comparison.

"Next week," Apiwat announces, checking the time, "Travel Demand Management."

The class dismisses, stepping out of the lecture hall and into the streets of Bangkok, where, somewhere nearby, a mutilated doll is undoubtedly guarding a spot for a Mercedes.
