# Bioenergy emissions and removals accounting
The accounting framework breaks down as follows:

### 1. Biogenic CO2 Emissions from Combustion

The Standard establishes that biogenic CO2 emissions are not zero and bioenergy cannot be assumed to be carbon neutral. Companies must account for Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 biogenic product CO2 emissions at the point of oxidation (combustion) using specific emission factors.

How these emissions are reported depends on whether the company accounts for the full life cycle impacts:

- **Scenario 1 (Gross CO2 Fluxes):** If the reporting company accounts for and reports **all life cycle GHG emissions** (including annual net land carbon stock changes of sourcing lands) and **land carbon leakage** (where required), they report biogenic CO2 emissions separately from the physical GHG inventory under the category **"gross CO2 fluxes"**,. This ensures transparency and avoids double counting, as the net carbon impact is captured through the land sector accounting.
- **Scenario 2 (Land Emissions):** If the company does **not** report all life cycle GHG emissions and land carbon leakage, or lacks traceability to the country of origin, they must report biogenic CO2 emissions under **"land emissions"** within the physical GHG inventory (Scope 1, 2, or 3 corresponding to the point of oxidation).

### 2. Non-CO2 Emissions

Regardless of the scenario above, companies must account for direct and indirect **biogenic product CH4 and N2O emissions** from combustion. These are reported in the scope corresponding to the point of oxidation under the **"biogenic product emissions"** accounting category within "land emissions" in the physical GHG inventory.

### 3. Upstream Life Cycle Accounting

For bioenergy consumed by the reporting company, upstream life cycle GHG emissions, land use, and leakage are reported in **Scope 3, Category 3** (Fuel- and energy-related activities). This includes:

- **Land Use Change (LUC) Emissions:** Emissions from the recent conversion of natural ecosystems to agricultural land for bioenergy feedstocks,.
- **Land Management Emissions:** Net biogenic CO2 emissions (e.g., soil carbon losses) and production emissions (e.g., fertilizer application, machinery) occurring on the land where feedstocks are grown,.
- **Land Use and Leakage:** Companies must report the land area occupied (in hectares) and potentially the Carbon Opportunity Cost (COC) of land use,. Additionally, if the bioenergy comes from crops that displace food or feed production, the company must account for **land carbon leakage**,.

### 4. Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)

If bioenergy is coupled with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), it is treated as a removal with geologic storage.

- **Accounting Category:** Captured biogenic CO2 stored in geologic pools is reported as **"captured biogenic CO2 with geologic storage"** under the "removals" category.
- **Safeguard against Land Use Change:** To account for these removals, companies must demonstrate that there are **no significant land use change emissions** (defined as less than 5 percent of the sourcing area experiencing LUC) attributable to the biogenic materials,.
- **Correction for LUC:** If non-significant land use change emissions occurred, they must be subtracted from the amount of CO2 stored; these emissions count as land emissions and cannot be accounted for as removals.
- **Permanence:** Companies must account for all cradle-to-grave life cycle emissions and ensure ongoing monitoring of the geologic storage to detect any reversals or losses,.

### 5. Fossil Fuel and Industrial Emissions

Emissions from processing, transport, and non-biogenic sources involved in the bioenergy supply chain are reported as **"fossil fuel and industrial emissions"**. If data permits, on-site energy use for land management should be reported here, though it may be reported under land management production emissions if necessary.

# Updates on Bioenergy emissions
Based on the Pilot Testing Draft and the final Version 1.0 Standard, the requirements for biogenic emissions and bioenergy differ primarily in how they resolved open accounting questions, the specific reporting categories mandated, and the scope of land sectors covered.

The key differences are outlined below:

### 1. Resolution of Reporting Approaches (Open Question vs. Conditional Requirements)

The most significant difference lies in how companies report biogenic CO2 emissions from combustion. The Draft posed this as an "Open Question," whereas the Standard establishes a finalized, conditional framework based on data availability.

- **Draft Guidance (Open Question):** The Draft presented an "Open Question" regarding how biogenic CO2 should be reported. It proposed a primary approach of "stock-change accounting" (reporting net emissions/removals in the scopes) combined with "flow-based accounting" (reporting gross emissions outside the scopes),. It also considered alternative options, such as "Scope 1 if not Scope 3" or "Dual Reporting",.
- **Official Standard (Finalized Scenarios):** The Standard resolves this by mandating **Requirement 17**, which dictates reporting based on whether the company tracks full life cycle impacts.
    - **Scenario 1 (Full Tracking):** If a company accounts for all life cycle GHG emissions (including net land carbon stock changes of sourcing lands) and land carbon leakage, it reports biogenic CO2 emissions separately under **"gross CO2 fluxes"** (outside the physical inventory),.
    - **Scenario 2 (Incomplete Tracking):** If a company does _not_ have this life cycle information, it must report biogenic product emissions under **"land emissions"** within the physical GHG inventory (Scope 1, 2, or 3), effectively treating them similarly to fossil fuel emissions to ensure completeness.

### 2. Scope of Applicability (Forestry Exclusion)

The applicability of the bioenergy requirements differs significantly regarding the source of the biomass.

- **Draft Guidance:** The Draft was designed to cover "all land sector activities," explicitly including forestry and forest products.
- **Official Standard:** Version 1.0 applies to **agriculture** and **CO2 removal technologies** but explicitly **does not apply to forestry** or forest carbon accounting,. While Requirement 17 applies to "non-food, non-feed biogenic products" generally, the Standard notes that requirements regarding forest product carbon storage are pending future versions.<!--note: very crucial-->

### 3. Classification of Biogenic CO2 Emissions

Both documents agree that biogenic emissions are not zero, but the Standard provides more definitive categorization instructions.

- **Draft Guidance:** Proposed reporting "Gross biogenic product CO2 emissions" separately from the scopes to avoid double counting with the net land carbon stock changes included in the scopes,.
- **Official Standard:** Reaffirms that biogenic products "cannot be assumed to be carbon neutral". It introduces specific accounting categories:
    - **Biogenic Product Emissions:** Includes CO2 (conditional on Scenario 1 vs. 2), CH4, and N2O released at the point of oxidation (combustion or decomposition),.
    - **Land Management Production Emissions:** A specific category for non-CO2 emissions (e.g., biomass burning) and non-biogenic CO2 (e.g., lime application),.

### 4. Upstream Accounting for Bioenergy

The Standard solidifies the requirements for reporting upstream impacts of bioenergy consumed by the company.

- **Draft Guidance:** Required companies to account for scope 3 emissions from purchased bioenergy, including land use change.
- **Official Standard:** Explicitly mandates that for bioenergy consumed by the reporting company, upstream life cycle GHG emissions, land use, and leakage must be reported in **Scope 3, Category 3** (Fuel- and energy-related activities). It clarifies that if land emissions are not reported upstream, the combustion emissions must be reported in the physical inventory (Scenario 2) to ensure the climate impact is captured.

### 5. Product Carbon Storage

- **Draft Guidance:** Included an "Open Question #2" regarding whether removals with product storage should be reported in Scope 3 or as a separate category,.
- **Official Standard:** Decides that **product carbon storage** is an optional category reported **separately from the physical GHG inventory**. It is treated as a separate metric rather than a removal that nets out emissions in the main inventory.

# Update on Land Tracking Metrics
Based on the transition from the Pilot Testing Draft to the Official Standard (Version 1.0), the reporting requirements for **Carbon Opportunity Cost (COC)** and **Land Carbon Leakage** have shifted from a "menu of options" approach to specific mandates and recommendations.

Here is how the status of these metrics changed:

### 1. Draft Version: "Choose One" (Optional in Practice)

In the **Draft Version**, companies were required to account for and report **at least one** of three "land tracking metrics." Companies could choose which one to report based on their data availability and goals. The three options were:

- Indirect land use change (iLUC) emissions (the draft's primary metric for leakage)
- Carbon opportunity costs (COC)
- Land occupation

Therefore, in the Draft, both **COC** and **Leakage (iLUC)** were optional in the sense that a company could choose to report **Land Occupation** instead and still be in compliance,.

### 2. Official Standard: Changed Status

In the **Official Standard**, the "choose one" approach was removed. The metrics were split into separate requirements with different levels of obligation:

**A. Land Carbon Leakage is now a Conditional Requirement** Land carbon leakage is no longer purely optional. It is now a **conditional requirement** (Requirement 13).

- **The Rule:** Companies **shall** quantify and report land carbon leakage if they implement "high leakage risk activities" (e.g., displacing food/feed production to use land for fuel or other materials),.
- **The Change:** Unlike the Draft, where a company could simply choose to report land occupation and ignore leakage, the Official Standard mandates leakage reporting if specific risk conditions are met.

**B. Carbon Opportunity Cost (COC) is now Optional (Recommended)** The Official Standard makes **Land Occupation** the mandatory metric for land use, demoting COC to a recommendation.

- **The Rule:** Companies **shall** account for and report "Land occupation" (in hectares) as the required land use metric (Requirement 12).
- **The Status of COC:** Companies are **recommended** (but not required) to additionally report the Carbon Opportunity Cost of land use to quantify the climate impact of that occupation,.

### Summary Table

| Metric                            | **Draft Version**                                                                                                                        | **Official Standard (Version 1.0)**                                                                           |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Carbon Opportunity Cost (COC)** | **Conditional Option:** Required only if chosen as the single "land tracking metric" (could be skipped if Land Occupation was reported). | **Recommended (Optional):** Land Occupation is now the mandatory metric; COC is a recommended supplement.     |
| **Land Carbon Leakage**           | **Conditional Option:** Known as "iLUC." Required only if chosen as the single "land tracking metric".                                   | **Conditional Requirement:** Companies **must** report this if they engage in "high leakage risk activities". |

## High risk activities

Based on the **Land Sector and Removals Standard (Version 1.0)**, "high leakage risk activities" are specific corporate actions that displace food or feed production, thereby creating pressure to convert land elsewhere to meet that demand.

### What are High Risk Activities?

The Standard explicitly defines three categories of activities as having a "high risk" for land carbon leakage. If a company engages in any of these, they are triggered to report land carbon leakage:

1. **Non-Food/Non-Feed Use:** Using food or agricultural products for purposes other than human food or animal feed. Common examples include using crops for biofuels (e.g., ethanol, biodiesel) or bio-based material feedstocks (e.g., bioplastics).
2. **Land Use Change Reducing Food Production:** Converting land from food production to another use to claim CO2 removals (e.g., converting cropland to forest land/afforestation). This counts as high risk if it causes a significant, long-term reduction in food production.
3. **Management Practices Reducing Yields:** changing land management practices to reduce emissions or increase removals (e.g., significantly reducing fertilizer inputs) in a way that results in a significant, long-term reduction in crop yields per hectare.

_Note: For the latter two, an exception applies if the change is made specifically to improve the long-term sustainability of food production._

### Why Do These Activities Trigger Land Tracking Reporting?

These activities trigger the requirement to report **Land Carbon Leakage** (a specific metric within the land tracking category) because of the global competition for finite land resources. The logic follows this chain:

- **Displacement:** When a company diverts agricultural land or crops away from the food supply (e.g., to generate bioenergy or plant trees for carbon credits), the global market demand for that food or feed does not disappear.
- **Market Effects:** This unmet demand must be satisfied by production elsewhere.
- **Indirect Land Use Change (Leakage):** To replace the lost production, other actors often expand agriculture into natural ecosystems (such as forests or grasslands) outside the reporting company’s value chain. This conversion releases significant GHG emissions.

Therefore, reporting is triggered to capture the **"systemwide impacts"** of a company’s actions. Without this requirement, a company might appear to reduce its own inventory emissions (e.g., by planting trees on cropland), while inadvertently causing deforestation and higher emissions elsewhere. The accounting ensures that these "hidden" emissions are quantified and disclosed.


# Updates on dLUC and sLUC

Based on the comparison between the Pilot Testing Draft and the Official Standard (Version 1.0), the core requirement to account for land use change (LUC) using either Direct (dLUC) or Statistical (sLUC) methods remains, but the **selection criteria** and **definitions** have become stricter and more structured.

Here are the key changes regarding direct vs. statistical land use change accounting:

### 1. From "Relevance" to a Strict "Hierarchy"

- **Draft Version:** Companies were instructed to choose the "more relevant" metric based on their circumstances. While dLUC was preferred for Scope 1, companies had flexibility in Scope 3 to choose between dLUC and sLUC based on data availability and goals,.
- **Official Standard:** The Standard replaces this flexibility with a mandatory **hierarchy of calculation approaches** based on accuracy and traceability,.
    - Companies **shall** select the most accurate approach their data allows.
    - **Priority 1 (Most Accurate):** LMU-level dLUC (requires complete traceability to the farm/plot).
    - **Priority 2 (Intermediate):** Jurisdictional dLUC (requires traceability to a region + spatial land use maps).
    - **Priority 3 (Least Accurate):** sLUC (used only when specific sourcing lands are unknown or only statistical data is available),.

### 2. Redefinition of "Direct" vs. "Statistical"

The Standard introduces a new sub-category that shifts how regional accounting is classified.

- **Draft Version:** dLUC was defined strictly as occurring at the farm or land management unit (LMU) level. Any calculation at a landscape or jurisdictional level was generally classified as sLUC.
- **Official Standard:** The definition of **dLUC** has expanded to include a **"Jurisdictional dLUC"** approach. If a company has traceability to a region (e.g., a state or province) and uses **spatial data** (maps) to track conversion on productive lands, this is now counted as **Direct LUC**, not Statistical,.
- **sLUC** is now strictly reserved for approaches relying on **non-spatial statistical data** (e.g., census data or emission factors) where crop extent maps are unavailable,.

### 3. Removal of Dual Reporting Recommendation

- **Draft Version:** To capture wider landscape impacts, the Draft suggested that if a company used dLUC for its scopes, it should _also_ account for sLUC and report it separately from the scopes,.
- **Official Standard:** This recommendation has been removed. The Standard now advises that companies should **not** use two different approaches for the same product type in the same jurisdiction. Instead, they must apply the single most accurate method available in the hierarchy.

### Summary of Differences

| Feature            | **Pilot Testing Draft**                                                  | **Official Standard (Version 1.0)**                                                                     |

| **Selection Rule** | Choose the "more relevant" metric; dLUC preferred for Scope 1.           | Follow a strict **hierarchy** based on accuracy and traceability.                                       |
| **Regional Data**  | Generally classified as sLUC (Statistical).                              | Classified as **"Jurisdictional dLUC"** if spatial maps are used; sLUC if only stats are used.          |
| **Dual Reporting** | Recommended reporting sLUC separately if dLUC was used in the inventory. | **Discouraged.** Use a single, consistent approach per product/location.                                |
| **sLUC Status**    | A valid alternative option.                                              | Explicitly defined as the **"least accurate"** option, to be used only when better data is unavailable. |

## Data for dLUC calculation

Based on the **Land Sector and Removals Standard (Version 1.0)** and the **Pilot Testing Draft**, the acceptable spatial data and maps for calculating Direct Land Use Change (dLUC) depend on the level of traceability a company has (specific farms vs. regional sourcing).

To calculate dLUC, companies generally require the following types of spatial data:

### 1. Specific Land Boundaries (Polygons)

For the most accurate dLUC calculation (LMU-level dLUC), companies must have physical traceability to the specific land area.

- **Farm/Plot Level Data:** Data must be "spatially explicit," representing specific areas such as a farm, field, or plot (defined as a Land Management Unit or LMU).
- **Harvested Areas:** In some cases, the spatial data may represent the specific "harvested area," which is the precise agricultural land harvested at a given time,.
- **Geospatial Data:** The Pilot Draft specifies the need for "farm-level geospatial data" or traceability to mapped farms.

### 2. Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) Maps

To determine if conversion occurred, companies need maps showing the historical state of the land.

- **Time Series:** Maps should ideally cover the **20-year assessment period**. The Standard prioritizes having maps for "all or most years" in the assessment period, but at a minimum, maps including the **first and last years** of the period are required to assess change,.
- **Vegetation Classes:** These maps must distinguish between land use categories (e.g., forest, grassland, cropland) to identify transitions.

### 3. Crop Extent Maps (For Jurisdictional dLUC)

The Standard introduces a "Jurisdictional dLUC" approach for when a company knows the sourcing region but not the specific farm. This approach strictly requires:

- **Crop-Specific Maps:** A spatial, non-statistical "crop extent map" showing exactly where the specific productive agricultural land for that commodity is located within the jurisdiction or sourcing region in the reporting year,.
- **Overlay Analysis:** This crop map is overlaid with historical LULC maps to identify if the specific crop footprint overlaps with areas that were recently deforested or converted.


>[!important]
>The "crop extent map" required for Jurisdictional Direct Land Use Change (dLUC) refers to the **total map of that specific crop type within the jurisdiction**, not just the company's specific farms.

Because the Jurisdictional dLUC method is used specifically when a company **lacks traceability** to the specific farm or Land Management Unit (LMU), the map serves as a proxy to identify all potential lands where the product could have been produced.

Here are the specific definitions and requirements regarding this map:

#### 1. It represents "Attributable Productive Agricultural Land"

The Standard requires a "spatial, non-statistical crop extent map" showing the location of **"all attributable productive agricultural lands"** in the jurisdiction or sourcing region for the reporting year.

- **What this includes:** All lands in that jurisdiction that are currently producing the **specific product or material** sourced by the company (e.g., if you source soy from Mato Grosso, Brazil, the map must show _all_ soy production areas in Mato Grosso).
- **What this excludes:** The map must exclude lands designated as "non-productive" (e.g., deserts, water bodies), lands producing **different** products (e.g., corn fields, if you are sourcing soy), and lands with legal harvest restrictions (e.g., national parks).

#### 2. Distinction from LMU-Level Data

The Standard uses the type of map available to distinguish between calculation methods:

- **Company's Specific Map:** If you have a map of the specific farms you buy from, you have "complete traceability." In this case, you are required to use the **LMU-Level dLUC** method (Priority 1), not the Jurisdictional method.
- **Jurisdictional Crop Map:** If you do _not_ have complete traceability to specific farms, you use the Jurisdictional dLUC method. This relies on the "crop-specific map" for the whole jurisdiction to estimate the likelihood that your volume is associated with recent deforestation.

#### 3. Why "Total" Crop Map?

Using the total crop map for the jurisdiction allows the company to calculate a weighted average of land use change emissions for that crop in that region.

- The company overlays this crop extent map with historical **Land Use/Land Cover (LULC)** maps (showing deforestation/conversion) over the 20-year assessment period.
- This identifies how much of the _total_ crop area in that jurisdiction was recently converted from natural ecosystems. This regional "average" is then applied to the volume the company purchased.

### 4. Acceptable Data Sources and Technologies

The documents list several acceptable methods for deriving this spatial data:

- **Satellite and Aerial Imagery:** dLUC emissions can be derived from satellite imagery or remote sensing data. For example, the Pilot Draft mentions using "satellite data on tree cover loss" to monitor deforestation.
- **Field Data:** Ground-based inventories or field measurements are acceptable primary data.
- **Hybrid Approaches:** Companies can use a combination of field data, imagery, and modeling.
- **Databases:** Companies may use relevant tools and databases created by non-profits or academic institutions, provided they offer the necessary spatial resolution.

**Summary of Hierarchy for dLUC Maps:**

1. **Most Accurate:** Uses LMU-level data (specific farm boundaries) + LULC maps for the last 20 years.
2. **Intermediate (Scenario A):** Uses Crop-specific extent maps + LULC maps for **all/most** years.
3. **Intermediate (Scenario B):** Uses Crop-specific extent maps + LULC maps for **some** years (at least start and end).


## Use of Land Cover Data

While "land use" and "land cover" are technically different concepts (one describes the activity, the other describes the physical surface), the Standard relies heavily on **Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps** to detect conversion events over time.

Here is how land cover data fits into the dLUC calculation requirements:

### 1. It is Required for the "Hierarchy of Approaches"

The Official Standard explicitly lists "land use/land cover maps" as a data requirement for the most accurate calculation methods.

- **For LMU-Level dLUC (Most Accurate):** If you trace a product back to a specific farm or plot (Land Management Unit), you must verify the history of that land. The Standard requires a "Jurisdictional or sourcing region area **land use/land cover map**" for all or most years in the assessment period to prove whether conversion occurred.
- **For Jurisdictional dLUC (Intermediate Accuracy):** If you trace a product to a region (e.g., a state or province) but not a specific farm, you are required to use **land use/land cover maps** overlaid with a "crop extent map" (a map showing where that specific crop is grown).

### 2. Valid Data Sources

The Standard recognizes that land cover data is often derived from remote sensing.
- **Satellite Imagery:** The Guidance accepts dLUC estimates derived from satellite imagery, which fundamentally measures land cover (e.g., tree cover loss).
- **Field vs. Remote:** Companies can use field measurements, remote sensing data (of canopy cover, biomass height, etc.), or a combination of both.

### 3. The Distinction Between Cover and Use

While land cover data is acceptable, the Pilot Draft highlights a technical distinction companies should be aware of:

- **Land Cover:** The observed physical cover (e.g., deciduous forest, open water, bare ground).
- **Land Use:** The socioeconomic arrangements and activities (e.g., conservation, grazing, timber extraction).

**Why this matters:** Sometimes land cover data alone can be misleading. For example, a forest might be harvested (losing tree cover) but replanted immediately. Under a "land cover" definition, it might look like deforestation (conversion to bare ground). However, under a "land use" definition, it remains "Forest Land" because the activity (forestry) has not changed.

Despite this nuance, the IPCC land categories used by the Standard (Forest Land, Cropland, Grassland, etc.) are a mixture of both land cover and land use classes, making land cover maps a primary tool for compliance.

## Satellite-based data

>[!note]
>satellite-based land cover data is **acceptable** and is considered a primary method for calculating Direct Land Use Change (dLUC) emissions in the Official Standard (Version 1.0).

In fact, for many companies, satellite imagery is the most practical way to meet the requirement of verifying land history over the mandatory 20-year assessment period.

Here is a breakdown of how satellite data fits into the requirements:

### 1. Explicit Acceptance of Satellite Data

The guidance explicitly states that dLUC emissions can be "derived from satellite imagery".

- **Real-world Example:** The documentation highlights **Mars** as a case study. Mars calculated its GHG emissions from dLUC on mapped farms using "satellite data on tree cover loss".
- **Remote Sensing:** The Standard classifies "remote sensing-based calculation approaches" (which rely on satellite data) as a valid method for quantifying land sector impacts, provided they are calibrated with empirical data.

### 2. Role in the "Hierarchy of Approaches"

Under the Official Standard, satellite data is essential for generating the maps required for the higher-accuracy calculation methods:

- **For Jurisdictional dLUC:** This approach requires a **"crop extent map"** (showing where the crop is grown) overlaid with **"land use/land cover maps"** for the assessment period. Satellite imagery is the standard technology used to generate these spatial maps.
- **For LMU-Level dLUC:** If you are tracing to a specific farm (Land Management Unit), you need to prove the history of that land. Satellite imagery provides the necessary time-series data to verify if the land was converted from forest or natural ecosystems in the last 20 years.

### 3. The "Land Cover" vs. "Land Use" Nuance

While acceptable, you should be aware of a technical distinction highlighted in the guidance. Satellites measure **Land Cover** (the physical appearance, e.g., trees), but the Standard tracks **Land Use** (the socio-economic activity, e.g., forestry).

- **The Risk:** A satellite might see tree cover loss and flag it as "deforestation" (conversion). However, if that land is a managed forest that was harvested and is being replanted, the **use** has not changed—it is still "Forest Land".
- **The Solution:** The Standard requires companies to understand these definitions. While satellite data is the starting point, it may need to be cross-referenced with management plans to distinguish between a _harvest_ (temporary cover loss) and a _conversion_ (permanent land use change).

### 4. Calibration Requirement

To ensure accuracy, the Standard recommends that model-based or remote sensing-based approaches be **calibrated** using empirical, primary data specific to the land area. This means ground-truthing satellite estimates with actual field measurements where possible to confirm that what the satellite sees matches the reality on the ground.

# Why dLUC at the jurisdiction traceability level is acceptable?
Based on **Version 1.0 of the Land Sector and Removals Standard**, "Jurisdictional Direct Land Use Change" (Jurisdictional dLUC) represents a significant evolution in accounting methodology compared to the Pilot Draft. It serves as a middle ground between granular farm-level data and broad statistical averages.

Here is an elaboration on what it is, why it is now classified as "Direct," and when companies should use it.

### 1. What is Jurisdictional dLUC?

Jurisdictional dLUC is a calculation approach used to estimate emissions from recent land use change (LUC) when a company knows the **sourcing region or jurisdiction** (e.g., a state, province, or country) but does not have traceability to the specific farm or Land Management Unit (LMU).

Unlike statistical methods that rely on census tables, Jurisdictional dLUC is **spatially explicit**. To use this method, a company must perform a geospatial overlay analysis using two specific types of maps:

- **Crop Extent Map:** A spatial map showing exactly where the specific crop (e.g., soy, palm oil) was grown within that jurisdiction in the reporting year.
- **Land Use/Land Cover Maps:** Historical maps covering the assessment period (20 years) to identify where natural ecosystems (e.g., forests) were converted.

By overlaying these maps, the company calculates the carbon stock loss specifically on the lands where their crop is grown within that region, rather than applying a generic regional average to all lands.

### 2. Why is it accepted as "Direct" LUC now?

In the **Pilot Draft**, regional-level accounting was generally classified as **Statistical LUC (sLUC)** because it lacked farm-level precision. However, the **Official Standard** reclassifies this specific spatial approach as **Direct LUC** for the following reasons:

- **Physical Observation vs. Probabilistic Statistics:** Jurisdictional dLUC relies on **empirical observation** via satellite imagery (remote sensing). It identifies identifying actual physical overlap between the crop footprint and deforestation events. In contrast, sLUC relies on non-spatial statistics (e.g., census data indicating "crop area increased by X%" and "forest area decreased by Y%"), which requires probabilistic allocation (like the "product expansion" method) to guess the link between the two,.
- **Methodological Compatibility:** The Standard notes that Jurisdictional dLUC is "methodologically compatible" with LMU-level dLUC. Because both use spatial data to pinpoint conversion, a company can mathematically combine them—using specific farm data where they have it, and Jurisdictional dLUC for the rest of the volume from that region.
- **Accuracy:** The Standard establishes a hierarchy of accuracy. Jurisdictional dLUC provides **"Intermediate accuracy,"** ranking higher than sLUC (Least accurate) because it excludes non-productive lands and focuses only on the specific "attributable productive agricultural lands" for that commodity.

### 3. When will a company resort to this method?

A company is **required** to resort to Jurisdictional dLUC when it finds itself in the middle of the data hierarchy established in **Requirement 10**. Specifically, a company uses this method when:

1. **Traceability is Limited:** The company knows the product originates from a specific jurisdiction (e.g., Mato Grosso, Brazil) but **does not have complete traceability** to the specific farms (LMUs),.
2. **Spatial Data is Available:** The company (or its data provider) has access to a **crop extent map** and **historical land cover maps**. If these spatial maps are _not_ available, the company cannot use this method and must downgrade to **sLUC** (Statistical LUC).
3. **Avoiding the "Least Accurate" Option:** The Standard mandates that companies "shall select the most accurate calculation approach that their data availability... allow[s]". Therefore, if spatial maps exist, a company **must** use Jurisdictional dLUC rather than resorting to the less accurate sLUC method.

**Summary of the Hierarchy:**

- **Priority 1:** Traceability to Farm + Spatial Data $\rightarrow$ **LMU-Level dLUC**
- **Priority 2:** Traceability to Region + Spatial Maps $\rightarrow$ **Jurisdictional dLUC**
- **Priority 3:** Traceability to Region + No Maps (Stats only) $\rightarrow$ **sLUC**

#  Scope 3 Land Use Change (LUC) emissions 

These emissions represent the greenhouse gases released when natural ecosystems (like forests or grasslands) in a company's value chain are converted to other uses (like cropland) during a specific assessment period.

The specific requirements for Scope 3 LUC emissions are as follows:

### 1. Calculation Methods and Hierarchy

Companies must use one of three calculation approaches based on their level of **traceability** to the land. The Standard mandates a hierarchy where companies must select the most accurate approach their data allows.

- **LMU-Level Direct LUC (dLUC):** Required if the company has traceability to the specific **Land Management Unit (LMU)** (e.g., a specific farm or plot). This is the most accurate method.
- **Jurisdictional Direct LUC (dLUC):** Used when the company traces products to a **sourcing region or jurisdiction** and has spatial data (maps) to identify LUC on productive lands within that region.
- **Statistical LUC (sLUC):** Used when the company traces products to a **sourcing region or jurisdiction** but lacks spatial maps, relying instead on statistical data (e.g., census data) to estimate conversion.

**Consistency Rule:** Companies generally should not use two different approaches (e.g., dLUC and sLUC) for the same product type sourced from the same jurisdiction.

### 2. Time Period and Discounting

- **Assessment Period:** Companies must account for LUC emissions that occurred over a period of at least **20 years** prior to the reporting year (or the length of the crop rotation/cultivation cycle if longer than 20 years).
- **Discounting:** Total emissions from the conversion event are distributed across the assessment period. The Standard requires **linear discounting** (allocating an equal portion of the total emissions to each year of the period), unless specific exceptions for Jurisdictional dLUC apply.

### 3. Carbon Pools and Greenhouse Gases

- **Gases:** Companies must account for **CO2**, **CH4**, and **N2O** emissions caused by land use change.
- **Carbon Pools:** Accounting must include carbon stock decreases across **all** land carbon pools:
    - Aboveground biomass
    - Belowground biomass
    - Dead organic matter
    - Soil organic carbon.

### 4. Allocation (Assigning Emissions to Products)

For **Statistical LUC (sLUC)**, companies are required to use the **Product Expansion Allocation Method**. This attributes emissions only to crops/products that are expanding their land area in the region.

- _Exception:_ Companies may use the "Shared Responsibility" method (allocating emissions to all crops produced in the region) only if they provide specific justification.

### 5. Specific Sector Requirements

- **Animal Products:** Companies with animal products in their Scope 3 inventory must account for LUC emissions on both the land used for **grazing** and the cropland used to produce **animal feed**.
- **Hydropower and Water Reservoirs:** Companies purchasing electricity from hydropower or using water from reservoirs must account for emissions from those reservoirs as Land Use Change emissions.

### 6. Reporting Requirements

Companies must report Scope 3 LUC emissions separately under the **"Land Emissions"** category. They must disclose:

- The calculation approach used (dLUC or sLUC) and justification for it.
- The assessment period used (e.g., 20 years).
- The level of traceability (e.g., to the farm, region, or country).
- For sLUC, the allocation method used.
- 
# Allocation approaches

Based on **Version 1.0 of the Land Sector and Removals Standard**, the allocation methods differ significantly between Statistical Land Use Change (sLUC) and Direct Land Use Change (dLUC).

### 1. Statistical Land Use Change (sLUC) Allocation

For sLUC, the Standard prescribes specific methods to attribute emissions to products within a sourcing region.

- **Primary Requirement (Product Expansion):** Companies are generally required to use the **Product Expansion Allocation Method**.
    - _Definition:_ This method attributes sLUC emissions only to land-based products whose occupied area is expanding in the sourcing region. It assigns responsibility based on the relative expansion of lands used to produce that product.
- **Exception (Shared Responsibility):** Companies may use the **Shared Responsibility Allocation Method** _only_ if they provide specific justification.
    - _Condition:_ This is permissible if the company uses spatially explicit statistical data that does not enable the consistent representation over time required to apply the product expansion method.
    - _Definition:_ This method allocates emissions to all products produced on the land area under analysis based on their relative total area, regardless of whether a specific crop is expanding or contracting.

### 2. Direct Land Use Change (dLUC) Allocation

For dLUC, companies follow the broader **agriculture sector allocation recommendations** detailed in Chapter 6 (Data, Methods, and Allocation). There is no single "dLUC allocation method"; rather, companies must apply the same allocation method across all metrics (emissions, removals, etc.) for consistency.

The Standard provides a hierarchy for allocating dLUC and other land-related emissions:

**A. Allocation at the Land Level (e.g., Crop Rotations or Intercropping)** When multiple products are produced on the same land management unit (LMU), the Standard advises against physical allocation. Instead, companies should follow this hierarchy,:

1. **Economic Allocation:** Allocate emissions based on the share of the total economic value of all products from the production system.
2. **Area-Time Allocation:** Allocate emissions based on the square meter-year ($m^2year$) occupied by each product.

**B. Allocation at Processing Facilities** If dLUC emissions are tracked through to a processing facility where co-products are created (e.g., soy oil and soy meal):

- **Economic Allocation** is generally recommended based on the value of the co-products.
- **Physical Allocation** (e.g., by mass or volume) may be considered if physical factors best reflect the causal relationship between production and emissions.

**C. Reporting Requirement** When reporting dLUC, companies must explicitly disclose the allocation method(s) used.

## Area-Time Allocation approach
 **Area-Time Allocation Method** is a specific technique used to partition greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals among **multiple products produced on the same land**.

### What is the Area-Time Allocation Method?

This method allocates emissions, removals, and other metrics based on the amount of space and time a specific product utilizes.

- **The Metric:** It uses the unit of **square meter-years ($m^2\text{-year}$)** to measure the "footprint" of each product.
- **How it Works:** It calculates the physical area a crop occupies multiplied by the duration of time it occupies that land. This share of the total $m^2\text{-year}$ available in the production system is used to assign a proportional share of the total emissions to that specific product.

### When is it Used?

This method is primarily relevant for **"Allocation at the Land Level,"** specifically for **intercropping systems** where different agricultural products are generated on the same Land Management Unit (LMU) and benefit from the same inputs. It is used when physical allocation (e.g., by mass) is not recommended, which is the standard guidance for land-level allocation.

### Why is it Secondary to Economic Allocation?

The Standard establishes a strict **hierarchy of land allocation methods** for intercropping systems. Area-time allocation is secondary to economic allocation for the following reasons:

1. **The Mandated Hierarchy:** The Standard explicitly lists "Economic Allocation" as priority **1)** and "Area-Time Allocation" as priority **2)** in the hierarchy for intercropping systems. Companies are instructed to "Consider economic allocation" first, and only move to area-time if necessary or if it better reflects the system.
2. **Causal Relationship and Demand:** The general principles of allocation in the Standard state that companies should select the method that best reflects the "causal relationship" between the production of outputs and the resulting emissions, or where "demand" determines the emissions. In many agricultural systems, the economic value of the crops is the primary driver for why the land is managed in that specific way. Therefore, allocating based on value often aligns better with the drivers of the activity than simply measuring the time and space occupied.

In summary, while **Area-Time Allocation** is a valid alternative, companies should prioritize **Economic Allocation** (based on the share of total economic value) when separating emissions for crops grown together.



# Updates on removal reporting

Based on the transition from the Pilot Testing Draft to the **Official Standard (Version 1.0)**, the core principles of removal accounting (permanence, monitoring, and separate reporting) remain intact. However, the Official Standard resolves previous "open questions," narrows the sector scope, and introduces more specific safeguards for Scope 3 accounting.

Here are the key changes in removal requirements:

### 1. Product Carbon Storage is No Longer a "Removal"

The most distinct change resolves an "Open Question" from the Draft regarding whether carbon stored in products counts as a removal in the main inventory.

- **Draft Version:** Presented an "Open Question" on whether to report removals with product storage within Scope 3 or as a separate category,.
- **Official Standard:** Decides that **product carbon storage is not reported as a removal** in the physical GHG inventory. Instead, it is treated as a separate, optional accounting category called "product carbon storage". Companies report this metric separately from emissions and removals.

### 2. Forestry Excluded from Version 1.0

- **Draft Version:** Was designed to cover all land sector activities, including forestry.
- **Official Standard:** Explicitly **does not apply to forestry** in Version 1.0. The removal requirements currently apply only to **agriculture** and **CO2 removal technologies** (e.g., DACCS, BECCS),. Requirements for forest carbon accounting are pending future versions.

### 3. Traceability and Scope 3 "Safeguards"

The Standard introduces flexibility for Scope 3 traceability but adds strict safeguards to prevent over-claiming.

- **Draft Version:** Required traceability to the specific sink and carbon pools.
- **Official Standard:** Allows for **"Interim Traceability"** to a **sourcing region** (rather than a specific farm/plot) for Scope 3 Land Management Removals,. However, to use this flexibility, companies must meet specific **"Sourcing Region Safeguards"** (Requirement 20.1.LMR), which include,,:
    - Ensuring the same spatial boundary is used for emissions and removals.
    - Using conservative assumptions.
    - Demonstrating mechanisms to avoid double counting.

### 4. New Allocation Requirements (Requirement 22)

The Standard adds explicit rules regarding how removals are allocated in complex value chains to prevent double counting.

- **Draft Version:** Focused on avoiding double counting of Scope 1 removals.
- **Official Standard:** Adds **Requirement 22**, which mandates that the sum of allocated removals from a sourcing region or operation **shall not exceed 100 percent** of the actual removals occurring there. It also mandates that companies must not double count Scope 3 removals with other companies in the same tier of the value chain.

### 5. Categorization of Removals

The Standard refines the specific reporting categories for removals.

- **Draft Version:** Categorized removals by sink process (biogenic vs. technological) and storage pool (land, product, geologic).
- **Official Standard:** Mandates two primary subcategories under "Removals",:
    1. **Land management CO2 removals:** (For agricultural soil and biomass).
    2. **Removals with geologic storage:** Further disaggregated into "captured biogenic CO2" and "technological CO2 removals" (e.g., DACCS).

### Summary of Unchanged Core Requirements

Despite these changes, the fundamental pillars of removal accounting remain the same between both versions:

- **Optional Reporting:** Reporting removals remains optional in the GHG inventory,.
- **Separation:** Removals must be reported separately from emissions; they cannot be netted against emissions in the main inventory,.
- **Permanence & Monitoring:** Companies must still have ongoing storage monitoring plans and must account for **reversals** (losses of stored carbon) if they occur,.
- **Data Quality:** Companies must still use primary, empirical data specific to the sinks and pools (not just generic factors),.




# New requirements

### 1. New Mandate for Water Reservoir Emissions

The treatment of freshwater bodies represents a significant expansion in scope.

- **Pilot Draft:** Explicitly stated that it **did not provide guidance** on accounting for CO2 emissions and removals associated with freshwater-based carbon pools, noting that sufficient data was not yet available.
- **Official Standard:** Now includes **Requirement 10.2**, which mandates that companies account for emissions from **water reservoirs** as Land Use Change (LUC) emissions. This applies to companies that own reservoirs, purchase **hydropower**, or source agricultural products irrigated by water reservoirs.
    - _Specifics:_ Companies must account for emissions for the first **20 years** following the creation of the reservoir.

### 2. Adjusted Emissions for GHG Credits

While both versions discuss credits, the Standard formalizes the reporting structure to ensure targets are tracked correctly.

- **Pilot Draft:** Stated companies should deduct sold credits from target accounting to avoid double counting.
- **Official Standard:** Formalizes this into **Requirement 30**. Companies must calculate and report two distinct sets of values,:
    1. **Physical GHG Inventory:** Emissions and removals independent of any credit purchases/sales.
    2. **Adjusted Emissions and Removals:** Values adjusted for credits issued or generated within the boundary.

### 3. Specific Re-baselining Triggers for LUC

The Standard introduces specific rules for when base years must be recalculated regarding Land Use Change methods.

- **Pilot Draft:** General requirement to recalculate for significant methodological changes.
- **Official Standard:** Explicitly requires **re-baselining** if a company switches its LUC calculation approach (e.g., moving from Statistical LUC to Direct LUC) or changes the data quality (e.g., from non-spatial to spatial data) for a specific product and jurisdiction. This ensures that apparent reductions in emissions are actual reductions, not just improvements in data quality.



# Overview of Land Management Requirement Change

Based on the comparison between the **Pilot Testing Draft** and the **Official Standard (Version 1.0)**, the accounting requirements for Land Management emissions have changed in several significant ways.

While the core concept remains the same—accounting for emissions on land that remains in the same use (e.g., farming on existing cropland)—the Official Standard narrows the scope, renames categories, and tightens the rules on natural disturbances.

Here are the key changes:

### 1. Scope Restriction: Forestry is Excluded from Version 1.0

The most fundamental change is the scope of applicability.

- **Draft Version:** Requirements applied to **all** land sector activities, explicitly covering both agriculture and forestry,.
- **Official Standard:** The land management accounting requirements in Version 1.0 apply **only to agriculture** (specifically "productive agricultural lands"). The Standard explicitly states that accounting rules for forest lands and non-productive non-forest lands are **undecided** and pending future versions,.

### 2. Treatment of Natural Disturbances (The "Managed Land Proxy")

The Official Standard removes the flexibility companies previously had regarding natural disturbances on agricultural land.

- **Draft Version:** Companies could choose between two approaches: 1) Classify all land as "managed" (counting all natural disturbances like fires or storms as anthropogenic), or 2) Develop criteria to distinguish "managed" from "unmanaged" lands to separate natural impacts,.
- **Official Standard:** For productive agricultural land, there is **no choice**. **Requirement 15** mandates that _all_ changes in land carbon stocks are considered anthropogenic. Companies **must fully account** for all losses, including those from degradation, fires, storms, and other natural disturbances.

### 3. Change in Terminology and Categorization

The reporting categories have been renamed to be more specific.

- **Draft Version:** Used the term **"Land management non-CO2 emissions"** for gases like methane and nitrous oxide,.
- **Official Standard:** Renames this category to **"Land management production emissions"**. This covers the same GHG sources (livestock, soils, rice) but establishes a clearer distinction from carbon stock changes,.

### 4. Specific Inclusion of Peatland Rewetting

- **Draft Version:** Mentioned peatland _drainage_ impacts,.
- **Official Standard:** Explicitly lists **CH4 emissions from peatland rewetting** as a required source under Land Management Production Emissions (Requirement 16),.

### 5. Clarification on Fossil Fuel Emissions

The Standard provides clearer instructions on how to handle on-site fossil fuel use (e.g., diesel for tractors).

- **Official Standard:** Clarifies that emissions from on-site energy, fuel use, and machinery should ideally be reported under **"fossil fuel and industrial emissions"**. However, if data does not permit separation, they may be reported under "land management production emissions," provided the company discloses where they are reported,.

### Summary of Differences

# Manage Land Proxy and Natural Disturbance
Based on the **Land Sector and Removals Standard (Version 1.0)** and the **Pilot Testing Draft**, natural disturbances are a critical concept because they can suddenly reverse years of carbon sequestration.

Here is an elaboration on what they are, how they are defined, and the strict accounting rules governing them.

### 1. What counts as a Natural Disturbance?

Natural disturbances are non-anthropogenic events that cause significant losses of carbon stocks (CO2 emissions) from land. The documents define these as events "beyond the control of, and not materially influenced by, a company",.

Common examples cited in the Standard include:

- **Wildfires**,
- **Insect and disease infestations**
- **Extreme weather events** (e.g., storms, hurricanes),
- **Geological disturbances**

### 2. The "Managed Land Proxy": You Break It, You Buy It

A central tension in land accounting is determining whether a carbon loss was caused by human management (anthropogenic) or nature. The Standard resolves this using the **"Managed Land Proxy."**

- **The Concept:** Because it is methodologically difficult to scientifically separate human-induced impacts from natural impacts on managed land, the Standard assumes **all** flux on managed land is anthropogenic,.
- **The Rule (Requirement 15):** For productive agricultural land, companies **shall fully account** for all net land carbon stock losses, including those caused by natural disturbances like fires or storms.
- **Implication:** If a company manages a farm and a wildfire burns the crops or trees, the resulting CO2 emissions are counted as the company's Scope 1 or Scope 3 emissions. They cannot be excluded as "acts of God".

### 3. Transparency: Reporting "Gross" Emissions

Because companies must report these disturbance emissions as their own, the Standard recommends a transparency mechanism so companies can explain _why_ their emissions spiked.

- **Net vs. Gross:** While the mandatory target tracking uses "Net" emissions (gains minus losses), companies should separately report **"Gross biogenic land CO2 emissions"**,.
- **The Benefit:** This allows a company to show stakeholders that a spike in their carbon footprint was driven by a specific disturbance event (e.g., a massive wildfire) rather than a change in management practices.

### 4. Impact on Removals and Reversals

Natural disturbances pose a severe risk to **Removals** (carbon stored in trees or soil). If a disturbance occurs, it can trigger a "Reversal."

- **The Permanence Principle:** A removal can only be claimed if the carbon stays stored. If a natural disturbance releases that carbon back into the atmosphere, it is accounted for as a **Reversal**.
- **Accounting Rule:** If a company previously reported a removal (e.g., soil carbon sequestration) and a disturbance (e.g., drought or fire) later releases that carbon, the company must report this loss in the year it occurs.
    - If the land is still in the inventory, it is reported as **"Land management net biogenic CO2 emissions"**.
    - If the land is no longer in the inventory (e.g., the company stopped sourcing from that farm), it is reported as a **"Reversal"**.

### 5. Risk Management and Materiality

The Standard highlights that companies must assess the risk of natural disturbances when calculating the "materiality" of their removals.

- A removal stored in a high-risk pool (e.g., a forest prone to fire) is considered more material in terms of inventory risk than a removal stored in a low-risk pool (e.g., geologic storage of mineralized CO2), because the likelihood of reversal is higher.
- To claim removals, companies must demonstrate net carbon stock increases _after_ factoring out any losses due to natural disturbances,.



# Updates on Land Management

Based on the **Land Sector and Removals Standard (Version 1.0)**, the concept of "methodological tiers" applies through a hierarchy of **"Calculation Approaches"**.

Companies are eligible to use the approaches you listed, but their eligibility is strictly conditional on whether they are accounting for **Emissions** (carbon stock losses) or **Removals** (carbon stock increases), and whether they have the necessary data quality to support the claim.

Here is the breakdown of eligibility for each approach under the Official Standard:

### 1. No Carbon Stock Change Assumption

**Status: Eligible (Conditional)** The Standard permits companies to assume "no change" in specific scenarios to simplify reporting or ensure conservativeness.

- **For Land Management (Requirement 14):** If land carbon stocks are increasing (which would be a removal), but the company does not wish to (or cannot) meet the strict monitoring requirements to claim that removal, they are permitted to report **"zero emissions"** instead of quantifying the specific removal amount.
- **For Products:** Companies may use a **"Simplified approach"** where they assume there is no change in the biogenic carbon stock of products they sell. In this case, they report neither net emissions nor net removals from the product pool.

### 2. Activity-Based Approach

**Status: Eligible for Emissions / Restricted for Removals** This approach involves multiplying activity data (e.g., hectares of land under specific tillage practices) by an emission factor.

- **For Emissions:** This is acceptable, particularly for **Statistical Land Use Change (sLUC)** or when using standard emission factors for land management production emissions (e.g., fertilizer application).
- **For Removals:** Global average data (equivalent to **IPCC Tier 1**) is **not sufficient** to meet the primary data requirements for claiming Land Management CO2 Removals. To claim removals, companies must use data specific to the sinks and pools in their operations or value chain.

### 3. Model-Based Approach

**Status: Eligible (Must be Calibrated)** Companies may use biogeochemical or ecological models to estimate carbon stock changes.

- **The Requirement:** To be eligible, particularly for removals, models cannot rely solely on default parameters. **Requirement 21.LMR** and the **Model Calibration Recommendation** state that model-based approaches must be **calibrated** using empirical data specific to the land area, management practices, and climate.
- **Verification:** If using a model, the company must resample field data at least every 5 years to verify the model's accuracy.

### 4. Remote-Sensing Based Approach

**Status: Eligible (Must be Calibrated)** Companies can use satellite imagery or LiDAR to estimate biomass changes or land use transitions.

- **The Requirement:** Similar to models, remote sensing is classified as a valid calculation approach but should be **calibrated** with ground-based primary data to ensure accuracy.
- **Application:** This is frequently used for calculating **Direct Land Use Change (dLUC)** by creating land use/land cover maps and for monitoring biomass carbon stock changes.

### 5. Measurement-Based Approach

**Status: Eligible and Preferred (The "Gold Standard")**

- **The Requirement:** This involves direct sampling or inventory measurements of carbon stocks (e.g., soil samples, forest inventories).
- **For Removals:** This is the primary standard. **Requirement 21.LMR** states that companies shall account for removals using **"empirical data specific to the land carbon pools"**. Measurement data is required either as the direct estimation method or as the calibration dataset for models and remote sensing.

### Summary Table of Eligibility

| Approach              | Eligibility for **Land Management Emissions**             | Eligibility for **Land Management Removals** |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **No Stock Change**   | **Yes** (Report as zero/neutral if stocks are increasing) | **N/A** (Cannot claim removals)              |
| **Activity-Based**    | **Yes** (e.g., sLUC or standard factors)                  | **No** (Global/Tier 1 factors not accepted)  |
| **Model-Based**       | **Yes** (With calibration)                                | **Yes** (Must be calibrated with field data) |
| **Remote-Sensing**    | **Yes** (With calibration)                                | **Yes** (Must be calibrated with field data) |
| **Measurement-Based** | **Yes**                                                   | **Yes** (Required/Preferred)                 |
