Talk with Advantage and CU researcher
*Background*
- Advantage consulting ltd. is working on an M&E piloting project sponsored by DCCE. Project lead is Mrs Kaew. The project focuses on examining feasibility of gathering and aggregating data from an administrative unit, likely at the provincial level. The indicators will be grouped by sector. Cross-sectoral aspects are also included. The objective is to test if adaptation M&E framework could be implemented from area-based approach.
- Chulalongkorn University research team, led by Dr. Pavisorn or Dr. King, is working on an adaptation M&E data platform project. The project aims to design an adaptation M&E data system to gather data for reporting use cases. 

# Creagy Task3 of BTR project

key outputs: 
- baseline framework for M&E indicators
- data reference sheet for prioritized M&E indicators
important dates:
- February - March 2026: first draft of the baseline framework and data reference sheet
- May 2026 final version before a consultation meeting to gather feedback on the outputs

# Advantage consulting: M&E implementation pilot

Methodology
- review documents such as [[คู่มือการติดตามและประเมินผล Climate Change Adaptation]] developed by CU research team 2 years ago
- review GGA's decisions
- other docs
- develop methodology for data collection to track implementation of so-called adaptation progress of a pilot province. 
	- aggregate impacts of adaptation activities taken place in the geographical boundary. 
	- aggregate impacts of projects by sector
	- cross-sectoral aspects will also be examined

- criteria for selecting pilot provinces
	- from [[Sources/Spatial climate risk map DCCE v2|Spatial climate risk map DCCE v2]]
	- institutional readiness (cooperation and enthusiasm)
	- data readiness like availability and quality of basic datasets gathered by provincial officers

>[!comment]
>- difficult to find connections between project level output/outcome and sectoral area-level impact/outcome and finally, national level impact/outcome.
>- since the criteria of what is considered adaptation activities is still unclear, they find hard drawing lines to include projects that are within climate change adaptation scope (CCA).
>- line agencies are unaware of adaptation benefits their projects might generate.
>- current practice of aggregating and tracking CCA is subjective, depending on the knowledge and judgement of the reporters of the reporting agencies 
>- baseline values of impact and outcome indicators are missing


*important date*
- project concludes in June
- Site visit in February and March
- final report by May 2026 (I guess)
- April 2026 is data analysis

# CU research team: M&E data platform
*methodology*
- design a user interface platform (they call it 'e-form') to ask sectoral focal points to fill in data about 'adaptation indicators'
- The e-form will be done by March 2026. This form won't be filled by the focal points yet
- the indicators will refer to [[คู่มือการติดตามและประเมินผล Climate Change Adaptation โดย DCCE]]
	- monitoring indicators
		- exposure
		- adaptive capacity
		- sensitivity
	- evaluation indicators
		- sectoral target
		- resilience indicator
- They will emphasize the alignment of GGA indicators and the selected indicators from the groundwork
- These indicators of the groundwork have been consulted with sectoral focal points t ask whether they can find these metrics. 
- There have been some agreements among the focal points on which organizations have the power to make the final calls of the indicator values when these values are conflicting (might be reported by more than one organizations)
- These indicators are not project level (refer to [[คู่มือการติดตามและประเมินผล Climate Change Adaptation โดย DCCE]])
- They will consult with the stakeholders again in this project to confirm if these metrics and indicators are realistically obtainable and collect feedback on the user interface
- The data system will depend on dataset batch (via excel sheet) or APIs connecting to agency's data system directly if applicable 


# insight from DCCE
- sectoral resilience indices are planned to be final sectoral level impact/outcome indicators. However, the development of these indices will require the understanding of sectoral adaptation strategy of the key stakeholders. DCCE has a plan to build capacity for sectoral stakeholders to co create these indices.
- data readiness of different NAP sectors is not equal. Sectors like public health and agriculture are more ready as compared to human settlement sector. Two line agencies such as DPT (relevant to urban planning) and DDPM (relevant to disaster risk management) are the the solely data custodians of this sector. Data is still fragmented.
- Most focal points are 'departments' within Ministries. They are usually able to give us 'policy' information such as line agencies' strategies in their 5-year Master Plan. However, they might not have project-level data of different agencies in hands. 


# Observation and thoughts
1. Although the M&E indicator list developed by CU researcher is still not very academically rigorous, we might have to stick with the definitions of the words set by the CU researcher through out this project. Because we prioritize moving forward and sync the three projects. If we keep debating and arguing on the correct definitions of 'exposure', 'adaptive capacity' and the definitions and scope of adaptation M&E, we might not be able to finish the projects. The priority should be consistency of definitions across these three projects. Correction of definitions and adaptation M&E indicators can occur in the future and it will involve drawing new lines to manage the data and information in the system. 
2. Advantage consulting and Creagy will use the definitions and list of indicators set by the CU researcher. Advantage consulting will test the practicality of this list in the pilot areas. Creagy will complement Advantage consulting's work by prioritize impact and outcome indicators which could be established the 'baseline values' via data collection and processing approaches (either from official Thai gov sources or satellite/ global datasets)
3. CRDB project will create a comprehensive metadata database for all datasets of M&E data platform projects, RU-CORE spatial risk map, ADPC data, Advantage Consulting's area level data. This will be a supermarket of datasets for CRI to choose and design a data product under this project.
4. We will keep in contact with the CU researcher to understand more about their definitions of risk components and M&E indicators. We will try steer the direction of these two towards a more accurate ball park.
5. The overall synergy is
	1. CU researcher drafts the template for adaptation M&E at sectoral national levels
	2. Advantage consulting adopt the definitions and the e-form from CU research team and test it out in pilot areas
	3. Creagy support Advantage consulting's consulting work by selecting impact and outcome indicators that could be established baseline values
