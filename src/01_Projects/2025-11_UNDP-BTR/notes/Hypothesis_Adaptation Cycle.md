# Adaptation cycle
This is a central piece for developing the information service to support implementation of climate change adaptation. The cycle consists of 5 stages
1. Climate science foundation
2. Impact, Vulnerability, and Risk Assessment (IVRA): assess the current state of climate risk and socioeconomic and ecological vulnerability
3. Planning: create adaptation portfolios 
4. Implementation: finance and implement the adaptation portfolios
5. MEL systems: monitoring (part of implementation), evaluation (periodically), and learning (after project completion) to assess the effectiveness of adaptation 


Information service requirement of each stage
### 1. Climate science foundation
1. Objective of data products: persuasive and awareness-raising
2. Product design: synoptic and communicative product
3. Example of data products
	1. high level overview of climate hazards and impacts under future scenarios such as World Bank Climate Knowledge Portal
	2. High level index and ranking
		1. https://gain.nd.edu/our-work/country-index/rankings/
		2. https://www.germanwatch.org/en/cri
	3. Evidence of damage and loss from climate change impacts
4. Target users
	1. high-level policymakers
	2. ministers in government
	3. legislators
	4. senior civil servants
	5. leaders of civil society organizations
	6. private sector associations.
### 2. Impact, Vulnerability, and Risk Assessment (IVRA)
1. Objective of data products: 
	1. identify hazard, asset, vulnerability, and impacts
	2. define the priority risks that the adaptation plan will address
	3. create an empirical baseline against which future changes can be measured
2. Product design: diagnostic data product
3. Example of data products
	1. Climate risk map such as [[Evergreens/Spatial climate risk map DCCE v1]]. Helps prioritize provinces of high risk and vulnerable aspects in on indexed based approach. Used among Provincial climate change management plans.
	2. Vulnerability Index: Social and Infrastructure data reduced to composite indices. **still lack** 
	3. Resilience index:  the definition of resilience is very diverse and contextual. **still lack**. 
		1. Sectoral Impact indicator
4. Target users
	1. technical staff within government agencies 
	2. risk analysts
	3. academic researchers
	4. specialized consultants 

### 3. Planning
1. Objective of data products: 
	1. identify a broad range of possible adaptation interventions and best practices 
	2. create a comprehensive "long list" of potential options for further evaluation.
	3.  systematically compare the "long list" of options to select a prioritized portfolio for 
	4. 
	5. implementation
2. Product design: knowledge sharing, prioritizing, justifying data product

3. Example of data products
	1. impact chain database
	2. adaptation option catalog
	3. case study database
	4. cost-benefit analysis  
	5. multi-criteria analysis 
	6. other non-probabilistic framework
	7. financial and non-monetary analysis tool

4. Target users
	1. technical staff within government agencies 
	2. risk analysts
	3. academic researchers
	4. specialized consultants 
	5.  budget and finance committees
	6. municipal councils
	7. investment planners in development banks
	8. international funding agencies

### 4. Implementing
1. Objective of data products: 
	1. provide details for technical design
	2. assist with incorporating climate information into the content of analysis, projects.
2. Product design: tactical and operational knowledge
3. Example of data products
	1. climate allowance for infrastructure design 
	2. climate factsheets
	3. detailed impact maps

4. Target users

	2. engineer
	3. architects
	4. policy drafters
	5. legal experts
	6. community leaders
	7. social researchers

### 5.  Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning (MEL)
1. Objective of data products: 
	1. help decide whether to continue, modify, or discontinue adaptation strategies based on their performance.  
	2. feed back information into Stage 1 and 2 of the next cycle
2. Product design: **evaluative and adaptive** products
3. Example of data products
	1. Process indicators
	2. Outcome indicators
	3. ~~Impact indicators~~ done in stage 2
	4. M&E tool and guideline
		1. The indicators should contribute to the baseline information update

4. Target users
	1. program evaluators
	2. funding agencies

>[!Adaptation Cycle]
> A cyclical climate adaptation information framework where Climate Science Foundation creates demand for adaptation action, IVRA provides evidence base for decision-making, Planning translates evidence into actionable strategies, Implementation operationalizes strategies with technical guidance, and MEL creates institutional learning that informs the next adaptation cycle, resulting in iteratively improved adaptation outcomes over time.


>[!important] 25 Sep action items
>- Think about indicators and metrics for assessing the effectiveness of information services
>- Clarify the boundaries and interactions between stages, particularly how information flows between stages and how feedback loops operate
>- Develop more detailed guidance on how to operationalize the framework in different contexts (national vs. local, different sectors, different development levels)
