<!--To understand the consequences of implementing climate change adaptation actions, understanding the baseline is the first step. Baselines can be viewed from many angles; from project-level boundary , from program-level boundary, or even from the society as a whole. 

Often time, monitoring and evaluating adaptation effort is done through tracking indicators and metrics. Indicators are observables that could be qualitative and quantitative. Metrics have a more quantitative sense. Assessing baseline can mean simply picking a point value from an agreed base year. Some indicators are obvious; easily obtained through national census survey and consisting of only one variable. Some are not so simple, demanding multi-step calculation and a multitude of data sources across scales. 

Indicators types
1. **Output-based indicators** measure the **products and services delivered** as a direct result of activities within a development intervention.
2. **Outcome-based indicators** measure the **intended or achieved short-to-medium-term effects of an intervention’s outputs**. They represent **changes in development conditions** that occur between the completion of outputs and the achievement of impact.
3. An **impact-based indicator** measures the **long-term societal, economic, or environmental consequences** resulting from a development intervention. These indicators are used to assess the effectiveness of adaptation actions.

One way to frame the baseline framework is to serve the establishment of the pre-condition before implementing adaptation projects. The assessment takes place during the Impact, Vulnerability, and Risk Assessment stage at the beginning of the Adaptation Cycle. The information of the Baseline Assessment will be used in the "planning" stage where decisions on what strategies and measures would be implemented. It becomes relevant and crucial in the MEL stage. Thus, baselines can be viewed as indispensable part of the MEL process. In this case, baseline values are everything that need to be monitored and evaluated. However, the approach to derive the baselines values might be different depending on the types of indicators to be assessed. 
It can be at
- project-level
- program-level
- sector-level
- or national level
categories of baselines could be
- Economic
- Physical
- Social
- Finance
- Engineering
- Ecological
- Adaptive Capacity
- Policy

Baselines can also mean the states of things and entities like 

1. Physical Baseline:  reference climatology and hazard frequency that characterizes the physical environment over a specific historical period
2. Impact Baseline
3. Resilience Baseline
4. Readiness Baseline

Baseline 2 to 4 are like impact indicators


Research reports and literature on different approaches of baseline frameworks. Identify the context the baseline framework is applied to. The scope of the baseline assessment. The values that are derived from the assessment, who use them? and for what purposes?
