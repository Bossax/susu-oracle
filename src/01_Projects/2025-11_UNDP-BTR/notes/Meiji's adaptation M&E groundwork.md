# Executive Summary: The "Two-Track" Strategy

Meiji’s concept is fundamentally a **"Split-Level" M&E System**. She is explicitly separating the **operational tracking** (Monitoring) from the **impact assessment** (Evaluation).

![[pic/creagy adaptaion M&E concept.jpg]]
### 1. Monitoring vs. Evaluation

Meiji proposes a hard line between two distinct data flows (Slide 14):

- **Track 1: Monitoring (The "Accountability" Loop)**
    - **Owner:** Line Agencies (Water, Agriculture, Tourism, etc.).
    - **Focus:** **Outputs** and **Activities**.
    - **Data:** Raw numbers from projects (e.g., "500 ponds built," "1,500 farmers trained").
    - **Purpose:** To verify that government budget was spent as planned.
    - **Destination:** DCCE (as a repository).
        
- **Track 2: Evaluation (The "Resilience" Loop)**
    
    - **Owner:** DCCE / NESDC / Budget Bureau.
    - **Focus:** **Outcomes** and **Impacts**.
    - **Data:** Synthesized indices (e.g., "Reduced economic loss," "Increased water security").
    - **Purpose:** To answer "Did we actually get safer?" and report to UNFCCC (BTR/NC).
    - **Mechanism:** Meiji explicitly notes that _Evaluation indicators require further study_ to translate the Monitoring data into higher-level answers.
        

This separation is smart because it frees line agencies from the burden of complex impact calculations. They just report "what they did" (Monitoring), and DCCE/Consultants handle the "so what?" (Evaluation).

### 2. Standard Indicator Subset

To make disparate projects comparable, she proposes a **"Standard Output Indicator"** system (Slides 21-25). Instead of every agency making up their own metrics, they must map their work to a code like:

- **E-Series (Exposure Reduction):** e.g., `E-1.1` Area protected (sq km).
- **S-Series (Sensitivity Reduction):** e.g., `S-1.1` Area with reduced dependency on sensitive resources.
- **A-Series (Adaptive Capacity):** e.g., `A-1.3` People trained.

<!--comment:  There is missing explanation of the mapping between "monitoring" and sectoral goals-->

>[!bug]
>If we follow this structure, outcome or impact indicators are not guaranteed to be included in the M&E system. It risks quality of the M&E system in the long run.

<!--question: Crucial question, are we going to do the heavy lifting by challenging the misconception of outcome and impact indicators in this project? does it fall under our responsibility? do we risk clashing with the CU research team? -->



**Example from Slide 25:**
![[pic/example of applying DRS with the standard indicator set - 2.jpg]]
- _Project:_ "Building 500 farm ponds."
- _Standard Mapping:_
    - `E-1.1`: 20,000 rai of agricultural land protected.
    - `S-1.1`: 20,000 rai with reduced rain dependency.
    - `A-1.3`: 1,500 farmers trained.
        

**Strategic Value:** This allows you to mathematically **sum up** resilience efforts across different ministries. You can say "Thailand protected 50,000 rai total" by adding `E-1.1` from the Water Department + `E-1.1` from the Agriculture Department.

<!--comment:  however, these are output indicators so the mapping is quite straightforward. Thus, this is purely monitoring-->

### 3. Baseline Data Reference Sheet

This document (Slide 22) is the operational "manual" for the whole system

![[pic/operation of the standard indicator set by DRS.jpg]]

- **Function:** It defines the "dictionary" for the Standard Indicators (E, S, A series).
- **Role:** It ensures that when the Water Dept says "Protected Area" and the Interior Dept says "Protected Area," they mean the same thing.
- **Deliverable:** This is the primary output of **Task 3** in your workplan.
    
<!--note: this is "glossary" and will have to consult CU research team glossary and CRDB glossary--> 
<!--question: what is the definition and scope of the baseline framework and relation to the data reference sheet?-->

Given definitions of Baseline Framework
- Prioritize a core set of SMART
- Develop clear definitions, methodologies for assessment and units
- Provide data sources
- Summarize the availability, accessibility, quality, resolution, format of data source
- Harmonize collected data to ensure consistency
- QA/QC
