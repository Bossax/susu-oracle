- we create our version of word definitions 
- NAP's indicators are output-based but the actual content is outcome-based
- CU M&E indicators


~~- Project indicators need to match with adaptation output indicators~~
- Adaptation outcome indicators = output indicators?
- Resilience indicator = impact indicators defined by NAP
- [ ] Monitor vs Evaluate: levels of operation
- we lack adaptation strategies. Thus, adaptation projects are now BAU projects try
- Outcome = things that are not 100% under control of the project
