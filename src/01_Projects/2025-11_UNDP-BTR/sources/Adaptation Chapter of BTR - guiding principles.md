# Reporting guideline
The official guidelines for reporting on adaptation in the BTR are found in **Chapter IV of the modalities, procedures and guidelines (MPGs)** for the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF). These guidelines outline the information that Parties _should_ provide if they choose to include an adaptation chapter (A-BTR).

While the submission of the adaptation chapter is generally **optional** for all Parties, the guidelines strongly encourage its preparation to facilitate the Global Stocktake (GST) and the sharing of best practices. If a country submits a BTR jointly with its National Communication (NC) or uses the A-BTR as the vehicle for its Adaptation Communication (AdCom), adaptation information is required.

The MPGs structure the adaptation information into nine sections (A–I), covering the following topics:

## 1. Background Information (Sections A and B)

- **A. National circumstances, institutional arrangements, and legal frameworks:** This section covers national circumstances relevant to adaptation actions; institutional arrangements and governance relevant to adaptation; and legal and policy frameworks and regulations.
- **B. Impacts, risks, and vulnerabilities:** This includes current and projected climate trends and hazards; observed and potential impacts of climate change (including sectoral, economic, social, and/or environmental vulnerabilities); and approaches, methodologies, and tools used for risk and vulnerability assessments, along with associated uncertainties and challenges.

## 2. Planning, Strategies, and Mainstreaming (Sections C and D)

- **C. Adaptation priorities and barriers:** This section covers domestic priorities and progress toward those priorities, as well as adaptation challenges, gaps, and barriers to adaptation.
- **D. Adaptation strategies, policies, plans, goals, and actions to integrate adaptation into national policies and strategies:** This encompasses the implementation of adaptation actions in accordance with the Global Goal on Adaptation; the country's adaptation goals, plans, strategies, policies, and efforts to build resilience; the integration of the **best available science, gender perspectives, and Indigenous, Traditional, and local knowledge**; mitigation co-benefits from adaptation actions; the integration of climate change into development efforts; nature-based solutions; and stakeholder involvement.

**Adaptation priorities** refers to broad areas of action that countries have identified as a priority to implement under their adaptation process. For most countries adaptation priorities are likely to be identified within national adaptation plans and strategies, and/or within their NDCs.[^1]

**Adaptation barriers, challenges and gaps** refer to issues that inhibit a country’s ability to adequately and effectively adapt in their priority areas.[^1]

## 3. Implementation and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (Sections E and F)

### E. Progress on implementation of adaptation: 

This addresses the implementation of adaptation actions identified in Chapter D, progress on national and regional programs/strategies, actions from current and past adaptation communications or NDCs, coordination activities, and changes in regulations or policies. Developing countries may optionally provide supplementary information on the effectiveness of implemented adaptation measures and supported adaptation actions.

The information regarding the progress on the implementation of adaptation actions falls under **Section 4: Adaptation policy processes and actions** in the proposed template for the Biennial Transparency Report (BTR). This section consolidates reporting guidelines related to adaptation policy processes, implementation (MPG Section E), and results (MPG Section F) into one area to minimize overlap and enhance clarity.


Here are the specific recommendations provided by the report for writing this section, particularly concerning the progress and results of implementation:

#### 1. Prerequisite for Reporting: Use of MEL Systems

To effectively report on implementation and results, countries must have **Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) processes** in place. Information about implementation status and outcomes **can only be generated** through these systems.

#### 2. Reporting on Implementation Status

Reporting on the implementation status of adaptation policy processes is meant to be **relatively straightforward**. The report suggests two potential approaches:

- **Providing a List of Actions with Status:** Countries can list the actions planned under the adaptation policy process (e.g., in a table) and assign an **implementation status** to each. This status should use **simple but descriptive categories** that are comparable across actions, such as:
    
    - **‘yet to start’**
    - **‘under implementation’**
    - **‘completed’**
    - **‘delayed’**
    - **‘cancelled’**
    - This information should also include details like the lead implementing agency and implementation timeframes.
- **Providing a Statistical Summary:** Countries can summarize the status of actions statistically (e.g., report on the **number or percentage of actions** that are 'completed' or 'under implementation'). This information can be **visualized in a chart or graph** (such as a bar or pie chart). For more granularity, these visualizations could be **disaggregated by sector or priorities**.
    

### 3. Reporting on Results and Outcomes

The information provided on results will depend entirely on the capabilities of the country's MEL system.

- **Tracking Goals and Targets:** If the MEL system can monitor progress toward the instrument’s goals and targets, countries should report the **most recent monitoring data**.
- **Reporting on Evaluations:** If evaluations have been conducted (typically assessing effectiveness and adequacy), countries should report the results of these evaluations. This should include a **summary of the report’s key findings**, including the reasons why the policy or strategy was or was not effective, and any **recommendations for rectifying shortcomings**. Countries are encouraged to refer to and provide **links to the full proper assessment reports** to allow interested parties to access detailed information.

### 4. Highlighting Implementation Challenges and Barriers

In addition to reporting progress, countries should include information about any **major barriers and challenges** that are inhibiting implementation (e.g., finance limitations or lack of technical capabilities). Providing this context helps explain the state of implementation and **underlines the urgency of related support needs** articulated elsewhere in the report.

### 5. Scope of Actions to Report

Although all forms of adaptation policy processes and actions are relevant to report on, countries should prioritize reporting on their **main adaptation policy processes**. This generally means reporting on policy processes coordinated by:

- National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), strategies, or programmes.
- National climate change plans or strategies that include an adaptation component.
- The adaptation components of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

The relevant guidelines (MPG Section E) mandate reporting on the implementation of:

- Actions identified in the adaptation policy section (Chapter D of the MPGs).
- Steps taken to formulate, implement, publish, and update national/regional programs and policy frameworks (like NAPs).
- Adaptation actions from current and past Adaptation Communications or NDCs.
- Coordination activities and changes in regulations, policies, and planning.
- Developing countries may optionally include supplementary information on supported adaptation actions and the **effectiveness of already implemented measures**.




- **F. Monitoring and evaluation of adaptation actions and processes:** This covers the establishment or use of domestic systems to monitor and evaluate implementation (including indicators and approaches); how adaptation increased resilience and reduced impacts; instances where adaptation was not sufficient to avert impacts; and the effectiveness and sustainability of implemented measures.

## 4. Loss and Damage (Section G)

- **G. Information related to averting, minimizing, and addressing loss and damage associated with climate change impacts:** This addresses observed and potential impacts related to extreme weather events and slow-onset events, activities related to addressing loss and damage, and institutional arrangements to facilitate these activities. Reporting on loss and damage (Section G) is noted as more voluntary compared to the other adaptation guidelines, as it is prefixed by the word “may” rather than “should”.

## 5. Experience Sharing and Miscellaneous (Sections H and I)

- **H. Cooperation, good practices, and experience and lessons learned:** This section covers efforts to share information, good practices, experiences, and lessons learned regarding adaptation science, planning, and policy. It also addresses strengthening scientific research, systematic observation, early warning systems, vulnerability, and MEL.
- **I. Any other information related to climate change impacts and adaptation under Article 7 of the Paris Agreement:** This is a section explicitly allowing countries to include additional information about climate change impacts or adaptation that does not fit naturally into the other substantive sections.

The template proposed in the sources, designed to help countries structure their BTRs, generally follows this MPG outline but makes strategic deviations to minimize overlap and enhance clarity, such as combining implementation guidelines (Sections D–F of the MPGs) into one section, and giving prominent cross-cutting issues (like gender and Indigenous knowledge) their own distinct sections. For example, the template proposes ten sections: Sections 5, 6, and 7 focus respectively on "Integrating gender perspectives," "Integrating Indigenous, traditional and local knowledge," and "Monitoring, evaluation and learning," even though guidelines for these topics are spread across Sections D and F of the MPGs.

# Common Barriers and Pitfalls
Countries preparing the adaptation chapter of their Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs), or other related adaptation reports such as National Adaptation Plan (NAP) progress reports, should aim to avoid several common pitfalls related to data, consistency, capacity, and political transparency.

Drawing on the analysis of adaptation reporting practices and guidelines, countries should avoid the following challenges and barriers:

## Data, Methodology, and Consistency aspect
A major challenge in adaptation reporting stems from the **complexity and context-specific nature of adaptation**, which has historically inhibited the production of high-quality, comparable information.
### Barriers
1. **Insufficient Quality and Incomparability of Information:** Adaptation-related information submitted through previous mechanisms (National Communications and Adaptation Communications) has **"not been of sufficient quality to enable comprehensive global assessments"** of progress. The lack of consistency in _what_ and _how_ countries report is a significant barrier to using this information for aggregated assessments.
2. **Lack of Robust Outcomes Data:** Countries have generally been **unable to provide robust data about the outcomes of their adaptation efforts**, which is critical for assessing whether global efforts are successfully reducing climate impacts. This inability often stems from the absence of globally relevant and commonly agreed metrics for adaptation outcomes, such as expressing reductions in risk and vulnerability.
3. .**Data Gaps in Loss and Damage Reporting:** When reporting on loss and damage, countries are likely to find that they **lack robust data** concerning:
    - Loss and damage associated with **slow-onset events**.
    - **Anticipated future loss and damage**.
    - **Non-economic loss and damage**.
4. **Lack of Standardization in Data Collection:** The absence of standardized reporting across sectors often leads to **inconsistent information** for progress reporting.

### Pitfalls

1. **Over-Summarizing Key Information:** Countries should **avoid the temptation to over-summarize** when sharing good practices, experiences, and lessons learned, as this can result in the loss of **"valuable nuances"** necessary for other countries and actors to learn from these experiences.


## Process and Guidance aspect

Reporting is often hindered by organizational issues, lack of clarity, and resource constraints:

### Barriers

1. **Conflicting Priorities and Resource Constraints:** Insufficient funding and resources often lead to the **deprioritization of reporting**. Furthermore, factors like **strict deadlines, stakeholder consultation fatigue, and conflicting priorities** can hinder the process and result in delayed responses or low rates of data submission.
2. **Lack of Detailed Guidance:** The Modalities, Procedures and Guidelines (MPGs) provide a long list of topics but **lack direction on _how_ reporting on these topics should look in practice**, which contributes to inconsistent reporting.
### Pitfalls

1. **Skipping Sections or Failing to Provide Context:** If preparing a "light update-focused report," countries **should not simply skip** a section even if there is no major new information (e.g., on climate trends). Instead, providing a high-level summary and links ensures the report functions as a standalone product.
2. **Relying too Heavily on Hyperlinks:** While hyperlinks are useful for directing readers to technical reports or policy briefs, they **should not be used as a substitute for providing the most important information** within the report itself, as many readers may not use the links.


## Domestic Implementation and Cross-Cutting Issues

When compiling domestic progress, countries face challenges related to capacity, coordination, and handling politically sensitive data:
### Barriers
1. **Coordination Gaps:** Coordination mechanisms, such as inter-ministerial working groups intended to oversee the process, may not be fully functional or active during the reporting period, resulting in gaps in specific sectors or thematic areas.
2. **Lack of Understanding of the Process:** Actors in specific sectors often lack a **good understanding of the NAP process, their roles, or their reporting requirements**, which can lead to limited or weak reporting on relevant adaptation actions.
3. **Insufficient Reporting on Gender and Social Inclusion:** Most reports show **minimal reporting on the integration of gender and social inclusion** in adaptation, which is typically due to a **lack of gender-disaggregated data** and the challenge of tracking this cross-cutting issue across ministries.
4. **Political Sensitivity:** Concerns exist about **disclosing requested information due to the fear of revealing government failures or a lack of progress**, which can compromise transparency and result in incomplete results that cannot be thoroughly analyzed.
### Pitfalls
To maximize the benefits of reporting, countries should prioritize early action to address these challenges, for example, by **building capacity and raising awareness** within the process and **revitalizing the coordinating body**. Additionally, progress reporting should be built up over time, allowing countries to learn from early attempts and gradually refine the process.
