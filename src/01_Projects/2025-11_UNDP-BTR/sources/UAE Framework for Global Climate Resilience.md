>[!important]
>- UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience is considered GGA framework that provide more specific details than high-level language of GGA ( "Enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience, reducing vulnerability")
>- UAE Framework will improve our ability to measure progress on the GGA and maintain accountability.
>- The UAE FGRC is the culmination of the 2-year Glasgow-Sharm el-Sheikh (GlaSS) work program on the GGA with consultations with 100 of stakeholders.
>- The framework focuses squarely on the “collective well-being of all people, the protection of livelihoods and economies, and the preservation and regeneration of nature, for current and future generations, in the context of the temperature goal.”
>-  The framework establishes a two-year UAE–Belém work program – so named for the host cities of COP28 and COP30 – to develop more specific and standardized indicators for measuring progress toward the targets it outlines. 
>- Built upon existing framework like Sendai and SDGs.
>- What the UAE FGRC is missing is the inclusion of means of implementation—namely finance, capacity building, and technology transfer [](https://www.iisd.org/articles/deep-dive/uae-framework-global-climate-resilience)
>- **Means of Implementation** is emphasized in later versions to track finance, capacity, technology transfer (enabling factors of adaptation apart from the 4 stage cycle)


# Utility for Global Preparedness
The framework serves as a "political and methodological tool" to operationalize the Paris Agreement's adaptation goals through the following mechanisms:

- **Standardization of Metrics (UAE-Belém Work Programme):** The framework launched a two-year work programme to define indicators (quantitative and qualitative). This moves the global community toward a standardized data schema for measuring adaptation progress, similar to how mitigation is measured in CO_2e,.
- **Forward and Backward-Looking Functions:**
- _Backward-looking:_ It facilitates the "review of progress" during the Global Stocktake (GST),.
- _Forward-looking:_ It drives the enhancement of capacity and planning to meet future threats.
- **Integration of MEL Systems:** By mandating Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning, the framework encourages nations to move from ad-hoc responses to data-driven adaptation cycles, identifying gaps in finance and implementation,.

# Components of the Framework

The framework structures resilience into two distinct types of targets: **Dimensional** (process-oriented) and **Thematic** (domain-specific).

## 1. Dimensional Targets (Iterative Adaptation Cycle)

These targets model resilience as a continuous control loop known as the Iterative Adaptation Cycle (IAC), with a 2030 timeline (except for early warning systems, set for 2027).

- **Impact, Vulnerability, and Risk Assessment:** Conducting up-to-date assessments of climate hazards and exposure to inform decision-making.
- **Planning:** Developing National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) that are gender-responsive, participatory, and transparent,.
- **Implementation:** Progressing beyond planning to the actual execution of adaptation actions,.
- **Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL):** Establishing systems to track progress and recognize adaptation efforts, serving as a feedback mechanism for the Global Stocktake,.

### Targets
1. Impact, Vulnerability, and Risk Assessment (IVRA) similar to [[Projects/2025-11_UNDP-BTR/sources/National MEL System for Climate Change Adaptation]]
	1. by 2030 all Parties have conducted up-to-date assessments of climate hazards, climate change impacts and exposure to risks and vulnerabilities and have used the outcomes of these assessments to inform their formulation of national adaptation plans, policy instruments, and planning processes and/or strategies, 
	2.  by 2027 all Parties have established multi-hazard early warning systems, climate information services for risk reduction and systematic observation to support improved climate-related data, information and services
		- [[Comprehensive Risk Management]]
		- [[Thailand NFCS design]] 
2. Planning
	1. by 2030 all Parties have in place country-driven, *gender-responsive*, participatory and fully transparent national adaptation plans, policy instruments, and planning processes and/or strategies, covering, as appropriate, ecosystems, sectors, people and vulnerable communities, and have *mainstreamed adaptation in all relevant strategies and plans*
3. Implementation
	1. by 2030 all Parties have progressed in implementing their national adaptation plans, policies and strategies and, as a result, have reduced the social and economic impacts of the key climate hazards identified in the assessments referred to in paragraph 10(a) above
4. Monitoring & Evaluation
	1. by 2030 all Parties have designed, established and operationalized a system for *monitoring, evaluation and learning* for their national adaptation efforts and have built the required institutional capacity to fully implement the system

## 2. Thematic Targets
    
1. _Water:_ Reducing climate-induced water scarcity and enhancing resilience to water-related hazards toward secure and affordable water for all.
	
2. _Food & Agriculture:_ Achieving climate-resilient agricultural production, supply, and adequate nutrition for all through sustainable, regenerative, and equitable practices.
	
3. _Health:_ Increasing resilience to climate-driven health risks, improving health services, and minimizing climate-induced morbidity and mortality, with emphasis on vulnerable populations.
	
4. _Ecosystems:_ Reducing climate impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity via nature-based solutions and ecosystem management, protection, restoration, and conservation.
	
5. _Infrastructure & Settlements:_ Ensuring essential services and minimizing climate-related impacts on infrastructure and communities.
	
6. _Poverty Eradication & Livelihoods:_ Reducing adverse climate impacts on poverty and livelihoods, supporting adaptive social protection measures.
	
7. _Cultural Heritage:_ Preserving cultural practices and heritage sites, developing climate-resilient strategies and infrastructure with Indigenous and local knowledge.[](https://expo.napcentral.org/2024/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NAP_Expo_COP28-UAE-Framework-24april.pdf)

# Indicators
A “long shortlist” of approximately 490 potential indicators has been identified for the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience, corresponding to its 11 targets (seven thematic and four adaptation cycle). These indicators are being refined and narrowed down to at max 100, but below are examples of the types of potential indicators being considered:

[wedo: Why Gender Matters for Adaptation Indicators](https://wedo.org/why-gender-matters-for-adaptation-indicators-and-whats-at-stake-in-bonn-for-the-uae-belem-work-programme/)
## Thematic Targets — Sample Indicators
1. **Water:** Population access to safe and affordable potable water; reduction in water-related hazard impacts; percentage coverage of climate-resilient water supply and sanitation.
2. **Food & Agriculture:** Proportion of population with secure access to adequate food and nutrition; share of climate-resilient agricultural practices; food supply chain adaptation readiness.
3. **Health:** Reduction in climate-induced morbidity and mortality rates; coverage of climate-resilient health services; disaster preparedness in health infrastructure.
4. **Ecosystems:** Protection/restoration of terrestrial, inland water, and coastal ecosystems; implementation of ecosystem-based adaptation measures; biodiversity resilience metrics.
5. **Infrastructure & Settlements:** Proportion of climate-resilient infrastructure; population coverage of resilient essential services; disaster risk reduction for settlements.
6. **Poverty Eradication & Livelihoods:** Adaptive social protection measures; percentage of vulnerable population reached; resilience of livelihood systems to climate risks.
7. **Cultural Heritage:** Number of cultural sites protected using adaptive strategies; integration of Indigenous knowledge in resilience planning.

## Cross-cutting & Means of Implementation
1. Adaptation finance mobilized/disbursed (distinguishing grants vs. loans).
2. Technology transfer for adaptation solutions.
3. Capacity-building actions tracked through national or sectoral indicators.
