# Key directions
## 1. CRDB and BTR sync Climate impact and risk literature review
Task 1 of the UNDP BTR project requires the review of [[Climate Change Risk and Impact Study (IVRA)]] to input into the Adaptation Chapter.

The content 100% overlaps with TOR 5.5 of the DCCE-CRDB project, which is originally palned to be executed in late February 

Logically, the DCCE-CRDB project shall shift TOR 5.5 execution to January to leverage the complementary tasks.

However, this will result in making a new execution plan for Jan and Feb 2026.
## 2. CRDB as Central Data Catalog
CRDB project acts like 'glue' that patch work of all projects together.

Data catalog (metadata database) will be created and pool datasets collected through other projects
1. Datasets from BTR Task 2 collected by ADPC
2. Datasets of M&E indicators as specified by "e-form"
3. Datasets collected by Advantage Consulting from site visits

Then CRI project can come to shop datasets from this pool first. If the datasets are insufficient, then CRI will collect more data from site visits
1. Datasets used by CRI projects
