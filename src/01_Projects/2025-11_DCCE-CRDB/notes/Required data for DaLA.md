# Baseline data
- Gather at the inception of the project
- basic socio-economic data
	1. Physical assets
	2. Basic services
	3. Production and sale performance (economic productivity)
# Pre-disaster replacement cost
- Also part of basic datasets
- no market fluctuation is taken into consideration
- obtained through suppliers, contractors, businesses
# Post-disaster situation
- relies on field survey
- develop a scenario defining how the affected sector is expected to perform temporarily until full recovery and reconstruction are achieved.
	- depending on types of assets and recovery plans. It may take from several months to years.
- The **time frame** during this recovery is used for calculating '**loss**' 

# Estimate damage and losses
Damage = total or partial destruction of physical assets
Loss = 
sector-based definitions, parameters, and relationships
**water sector** for example , the usual damages are structural damage on dams, wells, pumping stations etc. Losses are additional operational costs during the recovery time. 

**housing sector**'s damages are straightforward. Losses are costs of providing additional shelter, lower rental revenues (landlord).
