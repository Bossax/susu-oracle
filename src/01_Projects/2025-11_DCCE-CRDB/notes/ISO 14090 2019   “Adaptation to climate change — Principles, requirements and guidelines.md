# Background
The standard **specifies principles, requirements and guidelines** for adaptation to climate change and is designed to be broadly applicable to any organization. It is not a detailed, prescriptive “step-by-step manual,” but rather a **consistent, structured framework** that supports adaptation planning and implementation at any stage of maturity. ([ISO](https://www.iso.org/standard/68507.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ISO 14090:2019 - Adaptation to climate change"))

The document describes an iterative and non-linear adaptation approach. It outlines a set of **high-level process phases** that organisations can use to structure their own adaptation planning procedures:

- **Pre-planning** – preparing the organization, assessing readiness and resources, and engaging relevant parties. ([Iteh Standards](https://cdn.standards.iteh.ai/samples/68507/2c6da705165b4bdc860ef5d3aa443cba/ISO-14090-2019.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Adaptation to climate change — Principles, requirements and guidelin"))
    
- **Assessing climate change impacts including opportunities** – identifying climate hazards, impacts, and opportunities relevant to the organisation. ([Iteh Standards](https://cdn.standards.iteh.ai/samples/68507/2c6da705165b4bdc860ef5d3aa443cba/ISO-14090-2019.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Adaptation to climate change — Principles, requirements and guidelin"))
    
- **Adaptation planning** – establishing priorities, embedding adaptation into strategies and policies, identifying a range of adaptation actions, and using appropriate decision-making methods. ([Experts CEN](https://experts.cen.eu/media/Experts/Trainings/2019/webinar_eniso_14090_climatechangeadaptation_2019-11-14.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "EN ISO 14090 – a new standard on climate change adaptation"))
    
- **Implementation** – moving from planning to execution with leadership and commitment and integrating adaptation into organisational processes. ([Experts CEN](https://experts.cen.eu/media/Experts/Trainings/2019/webinar_eniso_14090_climatechangeadaptation_2019-11-14.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "EN ISO 14090 – a new standard on climate change adaptation"))
    
- **Monitoring and evaluation** – tracking progress, evaluating outcomes, and using learning to adjust plans. ([Iteh Standards](https://cdn.standards.iteh.ai/samples/68507/2c6da705165b4bdc860ef5d3aa443cba/ISO-14090-2019.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Adaptation to climate change — Principles, requirements and guidelin"))
    
- **Reporting and communication** – documenting and communicating adaptation decisions and results. ([Iteh Standards](https://cdn.standards.iteh.ai/samples/68507/2c6da705165b4bdc860ef5d3aa443cba/ISO-14090-2019.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Adaptation to climate change — Principles, requirements and guidelin"))
    

These phases collectively form an **adaptive management cycle**, rather than a linear checklist: organisations may iterate between them as they learn and conditions change. ([Iteh Standards](https://cdn.standards.iteh.ai/samples/68507/2c6da705165b4bdc860ef5d3aa443cba/ISO-14090-2019.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Adaptation to climate change — Principles, requirements and guidelin"))

Because ISO 14090 is intentionally high-level:
- it allows **flexibility in tools, methods, and data** chosen by each organisation;
- it encourages integration of adaptation into existing governance and decision-making systems;
- it supports continual improvement rather than a one-time plan. ([Experts CEN](https://experts.cen.eu/media/Experts/Trainings/2019/webinar_eniso_14090_climatechangeadaptation_2019-11-14.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "EN ISO 14090 – a new standard on climate change adaptation"))
    

This means that when you derive an adaptation planning procedure from other sources (academic frameworks, policy guidelines, sector standards, etc.), you can **use the ISO-defined phases and principles as a benchmark** to check:

- whether all core elements are covered (e.g., risk and opportunity assessment, prioritization, implementation, monitoring),
- whether there is explicit attention to integration with governance and decision-making,
- whether the approach is iterative and adaptive rather than a fixed sequence, and
- whether uncertainty and stakeholder engagement are considered.

# *Adaptation Planning*
ISO 14090 places **Adaptation Planning** as a distinct clause within its iterative adaptation process, between _Assessing climate change impacts including opportunities_ and _Implementation_. The structure generally appears as:

- **Clause 5:** Pre-planning
- **Clause 6:** Assessing climate change impacts including opportunities
    
- **Clause 7:** _Adaptation planning_
    
- **Clause 8:** Implementation
    
- **Clause 9:** Monitoring and evaluation
    
- **Clause 10:** Reporting and communication
    

### Purpose of the Adaptation Planning Section

Adaptation planning in ISO 14090 is designed to help an organisation move from **impact and vulnerability assessment** to **defined, actionable responses** that are integrated into organisational governance, strategy and operations. It builds directly on risk and opportunity assessment and feeds into implementation planning.

### Key Elements in the Adaptation Planning Section

Based on clause outlines from secondary summaries and partial previews, the following elements are central to adaptation planning:

**1. Establishing Priorities**  
The organisation identifies and sets **climate change adaptation priorities** based on the assessments completed in the prior clause. Prioritization reflects both risks and opportunities relevant to strategic objectives and operational context.

**2. Integration into Policy, Strategy and Planning**  
Adaptation is not an isolated task; it should be **embedded into existing policies, strategies and planning processes**. This means alignment with organisational goals and decision-making frameworks.

**3. Identifying a Range of Adaptation Actions**  
A suite of potential responses is developed. These typically include structural, operational, procedural or capacity-building actions that address the organisation’s priority climate impacts and opportunities.

**4. Decision-Making Methods Suitable for Uncertainty**  
The standard emphasises the use of **appropriate decision-making approaches** that are capable of addressing climate change uncertainty and long-term horizons. Approaches may include risk-based, scenario-based, or iterative decision frameworks.

**5. Adaptive Management**  
Planning should adopt an **adaptive management approach**, meaning decisions and actions can be adjusted over time as new information becomes available or conditions change. This reflects the iterative nature of adaptation.

**6. Engagement of Decision Makers and Interested Parties**  
Key decision makers and relevant internal/external stakeholders are engaged in planning to ensure ownership, relevance and feasibility of planned actions.

### Adaptation Plan as a Deliverable

Within this clause, ISO 14090 describes the **Adaptation Plan** itself as a documented output that:

- Defines the **scope and boundaries** of the planning effort
    
- Establishes **baselines**, including climate information, system baselines and adaptive capacity
    
- Lists **adaptation actions and measures**
    
- Recognises links to **implementation planning, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting/communication**
    
- Includes provisions for **engagement with interested parties** and integration into organisational processes
    

(These details about the plan’s structure—scope, baselines, linkages—come from a partial clause preview in a secondary source summarizing clause headings. Exact workings require the official text.)

### How Planning Fits into the Overall Standard

ISO 14090 positions adaptation planning as part of an **iterative cycle**, not a one-time step. After planning, the organisation moves into implementation, then monitoring/evaluation, and periodically revisits planning based on outcomes, new assessment data or changes in context. Planning interacts with governance and information flows across the adaptation cycle
