## 1. Context and Strategic Cooperation

The Ministry of the Environment, Japan (MOEJ) supports Thailand’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) in developing the **"Thailand Climate Change Adaptation Information Platform (T-PLAT)"** under a Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC).

### Vision

To function as the central platform for Thailand concerning information on climate change risks and adaptation, while linking with the Asia-Pacific Climate Change Adaptation Information Platform (AP-PLAT) to contribute to adaptation efforts across Southeast Asian countries.

### Mission

- **Information Provision:** Provide data on climate change risks and adaptation and support its effective utilization in Thailand.
    
- **Capacity Development:** Promote capacity building and develop appropriate toolkits for adaptation.
    
- **Project Facilitation:** Facilitate the realization of climate risk-informed adaptation projects in Thailand.

> - **Stakeholders:** The ecosystem involves MONRE/ONEP (Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning) and MOEJ as core partners. Technical support flows from JICA, Universities (Kasetsart, Tokyo Univ., etc.), and research institutes.
>     
> - **Governance:**
>     
>     - **Steering Committee:** Comprising MOEJ, ONEP, ERTC, TRF, providing advisory and coordination.
>         
>     - **Working Group:** Comprising ONEP, ERTC, T-PLAT Secretariat, handling data collection and support.

## 6. Domain-Specific Content Examples

### Climate Change Scenarios

> **Diagram Description (Scenario Matrix):**
> 
> A 2x2 matrix categorizing future scenarios based on economic growth vs. environmental emphasis and global vs. regional cooperation:
> 
> - **A1 (High GHG Emissions):** Rapid economic growth, global cooperation, peak population mid-century, efficient new technologies.
>     
> - **A2 (High-Medium Emissions):** Regional economic growth, continuous population increase, slow and fragmented technological adoption.
>     
> - **B1 (Low Emissions):** Service/Information economy, global solutions, clean efficient technology, resource reduction.
>     
> - **B2 (Medium-Low Emissions):** Local solutions, intermediate economic development, diverse technological changes. (Thai text translated and summarized based on standard SRES scenarios context implied in source).
>     

### Greenhouse Gas Sources

> **Visual Representation:**
> 
> The architecture identifies primary emission sources across sectors:
> 
> - **Energy & Industrial Processes:** Smoke stacks ($CO_2, SO_2$), Aircraft ($CO_2$), Exhaust pipes ($CO_2, NO_x$), Oil extraction ($CH_4$).
>     
> - **Agriculture, Forestry & Land Use:** Deforestation ($CO_2$), Rice cultivation ($CH_4$), Livestock digestion ($CH_4$), Fertilizer use ($N_2O$).
>     
> - **Waste Management:** Wastewater treatment and landfills ($CH_4, CO_2$).
>     

### Climate Phenomena: Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)

> **Diagram Description:**
> 
> Illustrates the impact of Positive vs. Negative IOD on precipitation in Thailand:
> 
> - **Positive IOD:** Warmer waters in the West Indian Ocean cause rising air and rain in East Africa, while cooler waters in the East cause descending air and drought in Indonesia/Australia.
>     
> - **Negative IOD:** Warmer waters in the East Indian Ocean bring heavy rainfall to Indonesia/Australia (and potentially Thailand), while the West experiences drought.
>
