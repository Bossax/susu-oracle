# Technical Architecture and Strategic Framework for a National Climate Risk and Adaptation Data Ecosystem in Thailand

The establishment of a comprehensive data ecosystem for climate change risk and adaptation within the Department of Climate Change and Environment (DCCE) of Thailand represents a critical infrastructure requirement for the nation's transition toward a climate-resilient, high-income economy by 2037. This report delineates the strategic, architectural, and technical requirements for designing a conceptual data model that underpins a Climate Risk Information System (CRIS). The architecture must harmonize international best practices in data management—such as the Data Management Body of Knowledge (DAMA-DMBOK) and the FAIR principles—with the specific legal and operational mandates of the Thai government, including the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) B.E. 2562 and the Digitalization of Public Administration and Service Delivery Act B.E. 2562.

## National Strategic Context and Digital Infrastructure Mandates

Thailand's path to climate resilience is intrinsically linked to its digital transformation. The Thailand Digital Data Infrastructure Roadmap (DDIR) 2025–2029 identifies foundational gaps in skills, governance, and interoperability that currently limit the benefits of digital government. For the DCCE, these gaps manifest as siloed systems and fragmented data ownership, which impede the integrated modeling required for climate risk assessment. The mandate for the DCCE, as the UNFCCC National Focal Point, involves coordinating national greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation and adaptation activities, which necessitates a robust Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system.

### Legal Frameworks for Data Interconnectivity

The Digitalization of Public Administration and Service Delivery Act B.E. 2562 (2019) provides the primary legislative engine for the CRIS. Section 13 of the Act requires government agencies to facilitate the linking and exchange of digital data to enable inter-agency cooperation. Furthermore, Section 15 establishes the Central Data Exchange Center (GDX) as the hub for these transactions. The CRIS architecture must therefore be natively compatible with the GDX platform to ensure seamless data flow between the DCCE and other critical departments such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Transport, and the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA).

|**Legislative Instrument**|**Section/Provision**|**Strategic Implication for CRIS**|
|---|---|---|
|Digital Government Act B.E. 2562|Section 13|Mandatory data sharing and linkage among agencies.|
|Digital Government Act B.E. 2562|Section 15|Use of GDX as the central hub for data registries.|
|PDPA B.E. 2562|Section 19|Requirement for lawful basis and consent for personal data.|
|PDPA B.E. 2562|Section 37|Mandatory security measures and data destruction protocols.|

The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) B.E. 2562 introduces significant constraints on the use of socio-economic data for vulnerability assessments. Climate risk modeling often requires granular household-level data to assess susceptibility to hazards. The CRIS must implement cryptographic pseudonymization and tokenization techniques to protect personal data while allowing researchers to perform spatial aggregations. The DCCE acts as a Data Controller, bearing the responsibility for ensuring data accuracy and implementing mechanisms for data subjects to exercise their rights, such as the right to erasure and rectification.

## Architectural Paradigms: Data Mesh versus Data Fabric in Climate Ecosystems

A pivotal decision in designing the CRIS ecosystem is the selection of an architectural paradigm that balances centralized control with domain-specific expertise. Modern data architecture offers two primary frameworks: Data Mesh and Data Fabric.

### Data Mesh: Decentralized Domain Ownership

Data Mesh is an organizational and architectural approach that decentralizes data ownership to domain teams. In the context of the DCCE, this means the experts in the "Hydrology Domain" or the "Forestry Domain" would be responsible for their own data products, from ingestion to consumption. This model promotes agility and innovation, as domain teams are closest to the data and understand its nuances. However, it requires a high degree of technical maturity across all participating departments and necessitates federated governance to prevent the creation of incompatible data silos.

### Data Fabric: Centralized Metadata-Driven Integration

Data Fabric is a technology-centric approach that uses a unified layer of metadata and AI-powered automation to connect disparate data sources. It is particularly effective for organizations with fragmented systems that need a single semantic layer to query data across cloud and on-premise environments. A Data Fabric approach for the CRIS would allow the DCCE to maintain centralized oversight of security and compliance while automating the integration of external datasets from sensors, satellites, and other agencies.

|**Comparison Factor**|**Data Mesh (Domain-Centric)**|**Data Fabric (Technology-Centric)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Primary Goal**|Organizational agility and domain autonomy.|Technical integration and automated access.|
|**Control Model**|Decentralized; domain-led teams.|Centralized/Hybrid; platform-led.|
|**Governance**|Federated; global policies, local execution.|Unified; automated policy enforcement.|
|**Key Enabler**|People, process, and "Data as a Product."|AI, Knowledge Graphs, and Metadata.|
|**Complexity**|High organizational change required.|High technical tooling required.|

For Thailand’s DCCE, a hybrid approach is recommended. This involves using Data Mesh principles to assign data stewardship to domain experts (e.g., the Pollution Control Department owning waste management data) while leveraging Data Fabric technologies to provide a unified metadata catalog and automated governance layer for the CRIS.

## Conceptual Data Modeling for Climate Risk Information Systems

The conceptual data model (CDM) provides a high-level, technology-agnostic representation of the data entities and relationships required for climate risk assessment. It serves as a bridge between the policy requirements (the "what") and the technical implementation (the "how").

### The Core Risk Formula and Entity Relationships

The CRIS conceptual model is anchored in the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) risk framework, which defines risk as the intersection of Hazard, Exposure, and Vulnerability. This relationship is formally expressed as:

$$Risk = f(Hazard, Exposure, Vulnerability)$$

Where the function $f$ represents the potential for adverse consequences derived from the interaction of these three drivers.

- **Hazard ($H$):** Refers to physical climate-related events or trends, such as floods, droughts, or heatwaves. Attributes include intensity, frequency, spatial extent, and probability (e.g., Annual Exceedance Probability or AEP).
    
- **Exposure ($E$):** Refers to the presence of people, assets, or ecosystems in hazard-prone areas. Attributes include asset type (built vs. natural), population density, and valuation.
    
- **Vulnerability ($V$):** Refers to the predisposition to be adversely affected. It is further decomposed into sensitivity and lack of adaptive capacity.
    

The CDM must define these entities and their cardinalities. For example, a single "Hazard Event" may intersect with multiple "Exposed Assets," and each "Exposed Asset" possesses a "Vulnerability Profile" that may change over time as adaptation measures are implemented.

### Spatio-Temporal Requirements

Climate data is inherently spatio-temporal. The conceptual model must treat "Space" and "Time" as foundational dimensions. This involves modeling "Observation Points" (weather stations), "Gridded Data" (satellite-derived raster products), and "Future Scenarios" (Representative Concentration Pathways or RCPs, and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways or SSPs).

|**Entity**|**Primary Attributes**|**Spatio-Temporal Mapping**|
|---|---|---|
|Climate Indicator|Type, Unit, Method of Calculation.|Temporal (Annual, Decadal).|
|Observation|Value, Quality Flag, Instrument Type.|Point Location (Lat/Long), Timestamp.|
|Grid Cell|Resolution ($0.25^\circ \times 0.25^\circ$), Index.|Geospatial Polygon, Time Period.|
|Projection Model|Model ID (CMIP6), Scenario (SSP5-8.5).|Forecast Horizon (2030, 2050, 2100).|

## Logical and Semantic Data Modeling Best Practices

The logical data model (LDM) refines the CDM by adding attributes, primary and foreign keys, and enforcing normalization rules. In the CRIS, the logical model must support semantic interoperability—the ability for different systems to exchange and interpret data with a shared meaning.

### Semantic Layers and Knowledge Graphs

A semantic layer acts as an abstraction that maps technical database structures to user-friendly business concepts. It ensures that a metric like "Average Monthly Temperature" is calculated consistently across all reports and AI models. This is achieved by encoding business logic, formulas, and hierarchies in a centralized layer.

For complex climate relationships, a Knowledge Graph approach is superior to traditional relational models. Knowledge graphs represent data as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), allowing for more flexible queries. For example, a Knowledge Graph can easily trace the chain of causality from a "Sea Level Rise" (Hazard) to "Coastal Salinity Intrusion" (Secondary Hazard) to "Paddy Field Degradation" (Impact) and "Local Community Migration" (Socio-economic outcome).

### Normalization and Schema Flexibility

Logical modeling typically adheres to Third Normal Form (3NF) to minimize redundancy. However, the dynamic nature of climate research—where new indicators and sensors are frequently added—requires schema flexibility. The LDM should utilize "Late Binding" or semi-structured data formats (like JSONB) for rapidly evolving metadata fields, while maintaining rigid structures for core reference data (e.g., geospatial boundaries).

|**Feature**|**Relational Logical Model (3NF)**|**Semantic Knowledge Graph**|
|---|---|---|
|**Structure**|Tabular, fixed schema.|Network-based, flexible schema.|
|**Interoperability**|Limited; requires complex Joins.|High; uses URIs and ontologies.|
|**Query Logic**|SQL-based; focus on transactions.|Graph-based (SPARQL); focus on context.|
|**Primary Use**|Operational databases, MRV tracking.|Risk analysis, cross-sectoral insights.|

## Technical Methodology: Downscaling, MRV, and Physical Implementation

The physical data model (PDM) is the final stage, where the logical design is mapped to specific database technologies, taking into account performance requirements, storage constraints, and platform-specific features.

### High-Resolution Downscaling and Grid Management

Local climate adaptation requires data at much higher resolutions than those provided by Global Climate Models (GCMs). Downscaling is the process of transforming coarse data (e.g., $100km \times 100km$) into local-scale information (e.g., $1km \times 1km$).

The Spatial Interactions Downscaling (SPID) method is a leading statistical approach that uses Random Forest models trained on high-resolution reference data. The PDM must be optimized to store and query these massive gridded datasets. This often involves the use of "Data Lakehouse" architectures where data is stored in partitioned Parquet files, allowing for efficient parallel processing of spatial queries.

### Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) Logic

A core functional requirement for the DCCE is the MRV system for national mitigation actions. The MRV data model must track:

- **GHG Inventories:** Sectoral emissions based on IPCC guidelines (Energy, Transport, Waste, IPPU, Agriculture).
    
- **Mitigation Outcomes:** Reductions compared to a "Business as Usual" (BAU) baseline.
    
- **Data Lineage:** The auditable trail of every emission factor and activity data point.
    

Data lineage is critical for international reporting to the UNFCCC. The CRIS must implement column-level lineage to trace data from the source (e.g., a factory's fuel consumption log) to the final carbon estimate.

### Socio-Economic Vulnerability Indexing

Assessing adaptation progress requires modeling socio-economic indicators. The World Risk Index methodology provides a template for this, aggregating indicators of susceptibility, coping capacity, and adaptive capacity.

The mathematical representation of a Vulnerability Index ($V_i$) for a municipality involves normalized indicators ($I_j$) and expert-weighted factors ($w_j$):

$$V_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j \times I_{i,j}$$

The CRIS must support the storage of these raw indicators (e.g., poverty rate, literacy, number of hospital beds) and the versioning of the weighting models used to generate the composite index.

## Benchmarking and Quality Assessment of the Data Model

Benchmarking the conceptual and logical data models is essential to ensure they meet the rigorous demands of climate policy and scientific research. The primary benchmarking framework is derived from the DAMA-DMBOK standards.

### DAMA-DMBOK Quality Dimensions

Data quality in the CRIS should be evaluated across six primary dimensions as defined by DAMA :

1. **Completeness:** Do we have data for all hazards and all exposed sectors?
    
2. **Uniqueness:** Is each infrastructure asset represented once to avoid double-counting risk?
    
3. **Timeliness:** Is the data available fast enough for decision-making (e.g., real-time flood monitoring)?
    
4. **Validity:** Does the data conform to the expected format (e.g., ISO 19115 for metadata)?
    
5. **Accuracy:** Does the data reflect the real-world conditions (e.g., station observations)?
    
6. **Consistency:** Does the "Sea Level Rise" data match across different departmental reports?
    

### FAIR Principles for Climate Data Ecosystems

For the CRIS to serve as a national asset, it must adhere to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). This requires a robust metadata strategy. The FGDC recommends the ISO 19115 standard for geospatial metadata. A "Findable" dataset must have a unique identifier (like a DOI or UUID) in its metadata to prevent the loss of data lineage when URLs or titles change.

|**FAIR Principle**|**Implementation Strategy in CRIS**|**Technical Benchmarking Metric**|
|---|---|---|
|**Findable**|Implement a centralized metadata catalog (e.g., CKAN).|Metadata completeness score.|
|**Accessible**|Use open APIs and standardized protocols (e.g., OGC WMS/WFS).|API uptime and response latency.|
|**Interoperable**|Adopt common ontologies and semantic layers.|Number of successfully integrated cross-domain queries.|
|**Reusable**|Provide clear licensing and provenance documentation.|Percentage of datasets with valid licenses.|

## International Case Studies and Reference Architectures

The design of the CRIS can benefit from benchmarking against international climate services and frameworks.

### Australian Climate Exposure and Vulnerability Statistical Framework (ACEV-SF)

The Australian Climate Service (ACS) developed the ACEV-SF to organize statistical information across four domains: social, built, economic, and natural. Its primary goal is to identify data gaps and provide a consistent structure for climate risk analysis. The DCCE should adopt a similar domain-based organization to ensure comprehensive coverage of Thailand's priority systems.

### European Climate Risk Assessment (EUCRA) and CLIMAAX

The EUCRA framework identifies 36 critical climate risks to energy, food security, and financial stability. The associated CLIMAAX handbook provides a toolbox for Climate Risk Assessments (CRA), aligning data categorization with the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) Risk Information Exchange (RiX). This handbook emphasizes the need for high spatial resolution and the combination of hazard data with social and physical exposure datasets.

### Global Resilience Index (GRI) Risk Viewer

The GRI Risk Viewer is a portal that makes open data related to climate hazards, exposure, and vulnerability available for visualization. It uses IPCC definitions to build a shared understanding across different scales, supporting high-level screening of risks to assets and populations. For the DCCE, the GRI provides a benchmark for the "External Transparency" component of the data ecosystem.

## Strategic Implementation Roadmap for the DCCE Data Ecosystem

The development of the CRIS must be phased to ensure that foundational infrastructure is built before advanced analytical capabilities are deployed.

### Phase 1: Foundations and Governance (Months 1–12)

This phase focuses on establishing the "Rules of the Road" and the initial data catalog.

- **Data Inventory:** Conduct a comprehensive audit of all existing climate and socio-economic datasets within the Thai government.
    
- **Governance Framework:** Establish the Data Evidence Governance Board (DEGB) to define roles, responsibilities, and open data standards.
    
- **Metadata Harvesting:** Implement an initial metadata catalog based on ISO 19115 and DCAT-US standards to make existing data "Findable".
    
- **Legal Compliance:** Develop standard procurement language requiring vendors to provide data in open, non-proprietary formats.
    

### Phase 2: Interoperability and the Semantic Layer (Months 12–24)

This phase focuses on breaking down silos and enabling integrated risk modeling.

- **GDX Integration:** Connect the DCCE's core databases to the Government Data Exchange (GDX) to enable automated data sharing with other ministries.
    
- **Semantic Layer Deployment:** Build the centralized semantic layer to standardize metrics and business logic for risk assessment.
    
- **Downscaling Infrastructure:** Implement the high-performance computing (HPC) environment or cloud-native lakehouse required for processing $1km \times 1km$ climate projections.
    
- **PDPA Safeguards:** Operationalize tokenization and pseudonymization services for the secondary use of socio-economic data.
    

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics and Global Transparency (Months 24–60)

The final phase scales the system to provide predictive insights and support international reporting.

- **AI/ML Integration:** Deploy machine learning models to automate the identification of exposed assets from satellite imagery.
    
- **Full MRV Automation:** Automate the data pipelines for the national GHG inventory, reducing reporting lag and increasing transparency.
    
- **Public Resilience Portal:** Launch the national CRIS viewer to provide citizens, businesses, and local governments with localized risk information.
    
- **Scenario Stress Testing:** Implement standardized climate scenario exercises to assess the vulnerability of the national financial and infrastructure systems.
    

## Conclusion: Data as a Pillar of National Climate Resilience

The design of a data ecosystem for climate change risk and adaptation is a strategic undertaking that requires a sophisticated understanding of data architecture, legal frameworks, and environmental science. For Thailand's Department of Climate Change and Environment, the success of the CRIS will depend on its ability to move beyond siloed repositories toward a modern, interoperable, and transparent ecosystem.

By adopting a hybrid Mesh-Fabric architecture, the DCCE can leverage domain expertise while ensuring consistent governance and technical integration. The conceptual data model, built on the IPCC's Hazard-Exposure-Vulnerability framework and benchmarked against DAMA-DMBOK quality dimensions, provides the necessary blueprint for this transformation. As Thailand faces the escalating challenges of the 21st century, a robust, evidence-based data ecosystem will be its most critical asset in protecting its people, its economy, and its environment from the impacts of a changing climate. The roadmap outlined in this report provides a clear path for the DCCE to deliver on its mandate, ensuring that every climate policy and adaptation action is grounded in the highest quality data available.
