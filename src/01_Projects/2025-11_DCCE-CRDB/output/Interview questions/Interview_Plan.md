# Interview Plan: DCCE-CRDB Project

This document outlines the plan for conducting stakeholder interviews for the DCCE-CRDB project.

## 1. Interview Goal

The primary goal of these interviews is to understand the needs, use types, and use cases of climate risk and adaptation information from various stakeholders. We aim to identify:

*   How data-intensive their current workflows are.
*   Where climate data becomes important in their analysis and decision-making processes.
*   The requirements for data and information services.
*   What primary data the stakeholders can contribute to the climate service.

## 2. Generic Interview Structure (50 minutes)

Each interview will last for one hour, with the first 10 minutes dedicated to project introduction and rapport building. The remaining 50 minutes will be structured as follows:

| # | Section | Duration | Objective |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Introduction & Warm-up** | 10 mins | Introduce the project and understand the stakeholder's role. |
| 2 | **Current Workflow & Data Usage** | 15 mins | Understand their current processes and how they use data. |
| 3 | **Climate Data Needs & Gaps** | 15 mins | Identify specific needs for climate risk and adaptation information. |
| 4 | **Data Contribution & Collaboration** | 5 mins | Explore potential data contributions from the stakeholder. |
| 5 | **Wrap-up & Next Steps** | 5 mins | Summarize the discussion and outline the next steps. |

This structured approach ensures that all key areas are covered within the time limit while allowing for some flexibility.
