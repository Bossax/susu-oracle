# Data Stewardship Policy

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes the framework for the **Data Stewardship Program** within the National Climate Adaptation Information Framework (NCAIF). Its purpose is to formalize the accountability and responsibility for managing the integrity, quality, and security of the nation's climate adaptation data assets. This policy operationalizes the principles set forth in the Data Governance Charter.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all individuals designated as Data Stewards and all data assets cataloged within the NCAIF. It outlines the procedures for the appointment of stewards, their core responsibilities, and the processes they will follow to manage data throughout its lifecycle.

## 3. Data Stewardship Model

The NCAIF adopts a federated, domain-based stewardship model. Data assets are grouped into logical **Data Domains** (e.g., "Climate Projections," "Water Management," "Adaptation Finance"). Each domain is assigned a lead Data Steward responsible for its governance.

### Key Roles:

* **Data Domain Steward:** A senior-level individual with recognized expertise and authority over a specific data domain. They are the primary point of accountability for the data within their domain.
* **Business Steward:** Defines and enforces data rules from a functional or user perspective. They ensure data is fit for purpose for stakeholders like policy planners and researchers.
* **Technical Steward:** Manages the technical lifecycle of the data, including its storage, movement, and lineage within the NCAIF's technical infrastructure. They are the custodians of the physical data assets.

## 4. Appointment of Data Stewards

1.  **Identification:** The Data Stewardship Committee (DSC) will identify critical data domains based on the CDM and the needs of the NCAIF **user journeys**.
2.  **Nomination:** The DSC will nominate potential Data Stewards based on their subject matter expertise, role within their home agency, and understanding of the data.
3.  **Appointment:** The Data Governance Council (DGC) will formally appoint the Data Stewards. Appointments will be documented in a central Stewardship Registry.
4.  **Training:** All appointed Data Stewards must complete a mandatory orientation program on the NCAIF data governance framework, policies, and tools.

## 5. Core Responsibilities of a Data Steward

All Data Stewards, regardless of their specific role, are responsible for the following activities for their assigned data assets:

### 5.1. Data Definition & Metadata Management
<!--note:  This project will establish the groundwork for this--> 
* **Action:** Create and maintain comprehensive business and technical metadata for each data element in the official Data Catalog.
* **Standard:** Metadata must conform to the NCAIF Metadata Management Plan. This includes clear business definitions, data types, valid values, and usage rules.
* **Rationale:** Ensures data is understandable, discoverable, and correctly used across the ecosystem.

### 5.2. Data Quality Management 
<!--note:  This could be in the second phase. Given the current situation of DCCE, where data products are treated as project outputs without long-term data management plans, the issue of data quality may have never crossed their mind -->
*   **Action:** Define data quality rules, thresholds, and validation checks in collaboration with data producers and consumers.
*   **Standard:** Implement data quality monitoring dashboards and processes as defined in the Data Quality Framework.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures data is accurate, complete, and trustworthy for decision-making.

### 5.3. Data Access & Security

*   **Action:** Review and approve requests for access to data, based on the principles of least privilege.
*   **Standard:** Classify data according to the Data Classification Policy (e.g., Public, Official Use, Confidential) and enforce corresponding access controls.
*   **Rationale:** Protects sensitive data while enabling appropriate access for legitimate users.

### 5.4. Issue Resolution
<!--note: This topic may have never crossed their mind-->
*   **Action:** Serve as the first point of contact for any inquiries, issues, or disputes related to their data assets.
*   **Standard:** Log, investigate, and resolve data issues in a timely manner, escalating to the DSC when necessary.
*   **Rationale:** Provides a clear channel for managing and resolving data-related problems.

### 5.5. Lifecycle Management
<!--note: This topic may have never crossed their mind-->
*   **Action:** Advise on data retention, archival, and disposal requirements.
*   **Standard:** Ensure data lifecycle practices comply with national regulations and agency policies.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures data is managed efficiently and compliantly throughout its existence.

## 6. Procedures & Operations

*   **Stewardship Meetings:** The Data Stewardship Committee (DSC) will convene monthly to discuss cross-domain issues, review new data requests, and monitor the health of the data ecosystem.
*   **Data Issue Log:** A centralized issue tracking system will be used to log and manage all reported data quality or governance issues.
*   **Annual Review:** Each Data Steward will conduct an annual review of their data assets to ensure metadata is current, quality rules are effective, and access controls are appropriate. The results will be reported to the DSC.

## 7. Enforcement

Adherence to this policy is mandatory for all appointed Data Stewards. Non-compliance may result in the review of stewardship appointments and will be escalated to the Data Governance Council (DGC) for resolution.
