 Data Governance Charter: National Climate Adaptation Information Framework (NCAIF)

## 1. Vision & Mission

**Vision:** To establish a trusted, unified, and user-centric data ecosystem that empowers all Thai stakeholders to make informed, timely, and effective climate adaptation decisions.

**Mission:** To implement a federated data governance framework for the National Climate Adaptation Information Framework (NCAIF) that ensures data quality, accessibility, security, and usability, thereby transforming disparate data assets into a strategic national resource for climate resilience.

## 2. Scope

This charter applies to all data created, collected, stored, and managed within the NCAIF, underpinned by the Conceptual Data Model (CDM). This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Risk & Vulnerability Data:** Climate projections, hazard maps, socio-economic indicators.
*   **Adaptation Actions Data:** Project details, implementation status, funding, and M&E results.
*   **Policy & Planning Data:** National Adaptation Plan (NAP), sectoral plans, and legal frameworks.
*   **Scientific & Research Data:** Academic studies, climate models, and impact assessments.

The governance framework covers the entire data lifecycle, from data creation and ingestion to archival and disposal. It governs the **people**, **processes**, and **technology** involved in managing the NCAIF data ecosystem.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

The primary goals of this data governance program are to:

1.  **Enhance Decision-Making:** Provide reliable and actionable data to policymakers, planners, researchers, and local communities.
2.  **Improve Data Quality & Trust:** Establish and enforce standards for data accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness.
3.  **Increase Data Accessibility & Usability:** Simplify data discovery and access through the user-journey-based NCAIF, supported by a comprehensive data catalog.
4.  **Ensure Compliance & Security:** Comply with national data protection regulations (e.g., PDPA) and international reporting requirements (e.g., UNFCCC BTR).
5.  **Promote Collaboration & Data Sharing:** Foster a culture of data sharing among government agencies, research institutions, and civil society.

## 4. Governance Structure & Roles

A federated governance model is adopted to balance central oversight with distributed data ownership and expertise.

### 4.1. ==Data Governance Council (DGC)==

The DGC is the senior decision-making body responsible for strategic direction and oversight of the data governance program.

*   **Chair:** Representative from the Department of Climate Change and Environment (DCCE).
*   **Members:** Senior representatives from key data-providing agencies (e.g., TMD, RID, DPT), strategic data users (e.g., NESDC), and the Digital/IT department.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Approve data governance policies and standards.
    *   Secure resources for data governance initiatives.
    *   Resolve escalated data-related issues.
    *   Champion the data governance program across government.
<!--note: This structure is new to DCCE. The readiness of staff's knowledge is doubtful -->   
### 4.2. ==Data Stewardship Committee (DSC)==

<!--note: This is entirely new structure-->

The DSC is the operational body responsible for implementing and managing data governance activities.

*   **Chair:** Head of Data Governance (or equivalent).
*   ==**Members:** Lead Data Stewards from each key data domain.== <!--note:  DCCE's internal committee which requires breaking data silos. New structure-->
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Develop and maintain data policies, standards, and procedures.
    *   Oversee the Data Stewardship Program.
    *   Monitor data quality and other governance metrics.
    *   Manage the Data Catalog and Metadata initiative.

### 4.3. Data Stewards

Data Stewards are subject matter experts responsible for the day-to-day management of specific data assets within their domain.

*   **Types:**
    *   **Data Domain Stewards:** Responsible for a logical grouping of data (e.g., "Water Resource Management Data").
    *   **Business Stewards:** Define business rules, data quality thresholds, and access policies from a user perspective.
    *   **Technical Stewards:** Manage the technical implementation of data assets, including data lineage and physical storage.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   Define and document data definitions and metadata.
    *   Implement data quality rules and monitor performance.
    *   Approve data access requests.
    *   Act as the primary point of contact for their assigned data assets.

<!--note:  internal capacity building is required-->

## 5. Guiding Principles

1.  **Data as a Strategic Asset:** Data is a critical national asset that must be managed to maximize its value for climate adaptation.
2.  **Federated Ownership:** Data ownership and stewardship are distributed to the most appropriate subject matter experts, while the platform is centrally managed.
3.  **User-Centricity:** Governance decisions will be guided by the needs of the end-users, as defined by the NCAIF user personas (e.g., Policy Planner, Local Leader).
4.  **Transparency:** All data governance policies, standards, and decisions will be clearly documented and accessible to all stakeholders.
5.  **Accountability:** Roles and responsibilities for data governance will be clearly defined and enforced.
6.  **Continuous Improvement:** The data governance framework will be regularly reviewed and adapted to meet evolving needs and challenges.

## 6. Approval

This charter is hereby approved and is effective as of [Date].

>[!comment] My verdict
>The capacity of DCCE's Risk Assessment sub-division to execute data governance is still not in place. Significant upskilling is required. The roadmap for data system implementation must include hiring of talents and train existing staff on data architecture and data literacy
