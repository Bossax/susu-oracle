# Plan for Refining Stakeholder Interview Questions

This document outlines the plan to refine the interview questions for the remaining stakeholders, incorporating specific details about their projects and roles related to climate risk and adaptation.

## 1. Analysis of Refined Examples

The provided refined examples for:
*   `Interview Questions กระทรวงการพัฒนาสังคมและความมั่นคงของมนุษย์.md`
*   `Interview_Questions_สำนักงานนโยบายและแผนการจราจรขนส่ง.md`
*   `Interview_Questions_สำนักงานสภาพัฒนาการเศรษฐกิจและสังคมแห่งชาติ.md`

demonstrate a need to move from generic questions to specific, context-aware inquiries. Key characteristics of the refined questions include:
*   **Reference to specific projects:** Mentioning projects like "พม. พร้อมรับ ปรับตัว" or "Urban-Act".
*   **Use of domain-specific terminology:** Using terms like "Social Vulnerability Index", "Impact Chains", or "Climate Economics".
*   **Connection to specific events:** Referencing events like the "น้ำท่วมหาดใหญ่ปี 2568".
*   **Focus on decision-making context:** Asking how data is used in specific high-level decisions (e.g., advising the National Strategy Committee).

## 2. Web Search Strategy

To gather the necessary information for the remaining stakeholders, the following search strategy will be employed. The focus will be strictly on **climate risk and adaptation**, excluding topics like GHG reduction, decarbonization, or Net Zero.

For each organization, I will search for:
*   **Official website:** To find annual reports, strategic plans, and press releases.
*   **Project databases:** Searching for projects related to climate change, disaster risk reduction, and adaptation.
*   **News articles and publications:** To find information about their involvement in climate-related initiatives.
*   **Partnerships and collaborations:** To identify joint projects with other relevant agencies.

**Search Query Template:**
`"[Organization Name]" AND ("climate risk" OR "climate adaptation" OR "disaster risk reduction" OR "vulnerability assessment" OR "resilience")`

This will be adapted for each organization.

## 3. Next Steps

Following the information gathering phase, I will:
1.  Synthesize the findings for each organization.
2.  Edit the corresponding markdown file to incorporate the new, specific details.
3.  Present the fully refined set of questions for your final review.
