# Alternative Data Governance Strategy: Compliance-First, Foundation-Forward

**Note:** This document outlines an alternative strategy for data governance implementation that was considered but not selected. It is preserved here for future reference and for contexts where compliance and risk mitigation are the primary drivers.

## 1. Guiding Principle & Rationale

**Guiding Principle:** "Build the strong foundation first, so the house stands forever."

**Rationale:** This strategy prioritizes mitigating risk and building a trusted, compliant data foundation *before* developing the full-featured NCAIF portal. It front-loads the organizational change, training, and policy work to ensure that when features are built, they are built on a solid, secure, and well-understood data ecosystem. It is best suited for environments with strong regulatory requirements or where data sensitivity is extremely high.

## 2. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Establish the Human & Policy Layer (Months 1-5)

*   **Action:** Focus entirely on organizational readiness. Delay significant new feature development.
*   **Governance Focus:**
    *   Formally constitute and charter the **Data Governance Council (DGC)** and the **Data Stewardship Committee (DSC)**.
    *   Nominate, appoint, and conduct intensive training for **all** key Data Stewards across domains.
    *   Ratify the core policies: `Data_Governance_Charter.md`, `Data_Classification_Policy.md`, and `Data_Stewardship_Policy.md`.
    *   Conduct a high-level, agency-wide data inventory to identify all potential data assets for the NCAIF.

### Phase 2: Implement Foundational Tooling & Govern Critical Data (Months 6-12)

*   **Action:** Procure and implement the **Data Catalog tool**. Begin a systematic onboarding of critical data assets.
*   **Governance Focus:**
    *   Data Stewards begin their duties, cataloging and documenting their assigned assets.
    *   **Crucially, every single asset is given a classification** (`Public`, `Official Use`, `Confidential`) upon entry into the catalog.
    *   Establish baseline **Data Quality** metrics for the 10-20 most critical national datasets.
    *   Develop a basic, functional version of the NCAIF that primarily serves as a front-end to the Data Catalog, focusing on discovery and understanding, not complex visualization.

### Phase 3: Build Features on a Governed Foundation (Months 13+)

*   **Action:** Begin the rapid development of the "Ideal Workflow" NCAIF portal (Option 2).
*   **Governance Focus:**
    *   Because the data is already cataloged, classified, and has quality baselines, development teams can build features with high confidence.
    *   Data access requests are managed through the established stewardship process.
    *   The governance framework moves from implementation to an operational "business as usual" rhythm of monitoring and improvement.

## 3. Pros & Cons

*   **Pros:** Minimizes security and compliance risks from the start. Builds long-term trust in the data. Reduces future rework by establishing clear standards early. Directly addresses the identified capacity gap before it can derail the project.
*   **Cons:** Slower time-to-value for end-users, who won't see advanced features for over a year. Risks losing project momentum if stakeholders don't see visible progress. Requires significant upfront investment in training and organizational change management.
