# NCAIF Material Synthesis: Findings from Inception Report (Chapter 3)

This document synthesizes findings from the Inception Report's benchmarking (Section 3.1) and current state assessment (Section 3.2) to inform the development of the **National Climate Adaptation Information Framework (NCAIF)**, as per the [Data System Artifact Guide](../notes/Data%20System%20Artifact%20Guide.md) and [Implementation Plan](./CRDB%20-%20Implementation%20Plan.md).

## 1. Benchmarking Insights for NCAIF Business Taxonomy

The review of international platforms (A-PLAT, KlimAdapt, Climate-ADAPT) provides a blueprint for the NCAIF hierarchical structure:

| Platform | Taxonomy Structure | Key Features for NCAIF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A-PLAT (Japan)** | 7 Adaptation Sectors (Agriculture, Water, Ecosystems, etc.) | Strong focus on **Impact Atlas** with high-res (1km) maps. Categorizes effort by stakeholder (Gov, Private, Individual). |
| **KlimAdapt (Germany)** | 6 Main / 16 Sub-sectors (DAS Strategy) | Use of a **Service Catalogue** with structured filters (Target group, Climate variables, Action fields). High emphasis on quality control and scientific basis. |
| **Climate-ADAPT (EU)** | 19 Policy Sectors | Integration with **Copernicus** for raw climate data. Use of "Country Profiles" and "Case Study Explorers." |

### Implications for NCAIF:
- **Sectoral Alignment:** NCAIF should align its Stage 2 (Risk) and Stage 3 (Adaptation) with Thailand's **NAP (6 sectors)**: Water, Agriculture, Tourism, Health, Natural Resources, and Human Settlements.
- **Multidimensional Tagging:** The taxonomy should support tagging by **Stakeholder Type** (as in A-PLAT) and **Information Type** (Maps, Reports, Data) to facilitate the "Librarian" role of the CRDB.
- **Metadata Standard:** Adoption of "Essential Climate Variables" (ECVs) from KlimAdapt as the basis for the Stage 1 (Meteorology) taxonomy.

## 2. DCCE Current State vs. NCAIF Requirements

The assessment of DCCE's current assets (Section 3.2) reveals the "raw material" available for the NCAIF:

| DCCE Asset | Current Role | NCAIF Mapping |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Risk MAP** | Spatial risk database (SSP2-4.5/5-8.5) | Primary source for **Stage 2 (IVRA)** taxonomy and technical metadata. |
| **T-PLAT.INFO** | Pilot coastal risk reports | Provides baseline for **Stage 2 (Impacts)** and **Case Study** categorization. |
| **CCE Center** | Local activity tracker | Source for **Stage 3 (Adaptation Measures)** at the local level. |
| **Data Catalog** | Basic metadata registry | The logical foundation to be reframed into the **NCAIF Business Glossary**. |

### Key Gaps Identified:
- **Semantic Fragmentation:** Projects use inconsistent definitions for "Risk," "Hazard," and "Sensitivity." NCAIF must resolve this via the **Business Glossary**.
- **Stage 5 (M&E) Gap:** Currently limited to activity tracking; needs "External Consumption Points" to link with the UNDP-BTR M&E framework.
- **Loss & Damage (L&D):** Current systems focus on potential risk; NCAIF needs a specific branch for **Actual Loss & Damage (Historical)**.

## 3. Refined NCAIF Structure (V1.1) - User-Journey-Based

Based on the Inception Report findings and the cross-analysis, the NCAIF structure is refined to support distinct user journeys:

- **Homepage:** National Climate Overview, Quick Links, Climate Alerts

- **For Policy Makers & Planners:**
    - Understand the Risks: National & Provincial Risk Assessments, Future Climate Scenarios
    - Develop a Plan: NAP Guidance, Adaptation Option Appraisal Tools, Financing & Investment
    - Monitor & Evaluate: M&E Framework, National Progress Dashboard

- **For Researchers & Academia:**
    - Access Data: Open Data Portal (API Access), Climate Model Projections, Socio-Economic Data
    - Collaborate: Research Network, Calls for Proposals
    - Publish: Journal, Working Paper Series

- **For Communities & Local Leaders:**
    - What's Happening in My Area?: Local Risk Maps, Community Vulnerability Assessments
    - What Can We Do?: Community-Based Adaptation Toolkit, Local Funding Opportunities, Success Stories

- **Explore Our Work:** Projects & Initiatives, News & Events, About Us

## 4. Next Steps for NCAIF Preparation
1.  **Extract Terms for Glossary:** Scrape definitions from the "IPCC AR6" and "Sendai Framework" references mentioned in the Inception Report.
2.  **Map Risk MAP Variables:** Audit the specific variables used in DCCE's Risk MAP to populate the Stage 2 Logical Model.
3.  **FGD 1 Preparation:** Use the "Stakeholder Mapping" from the Inception Report to identify participants for validating the NCAIF hierarchy.
