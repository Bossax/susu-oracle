### Retrospective: Evolution of the Presentation Design

Here is a summary of how the design strategy evolved after analyzing Professor Ton's slide deck (`อนาคตเด็กและเยาวชนในสังคมไทย 2 (ล่าสุด).pptx`).

#### **1. The Narrative Pivot: From "Trends" to "Rupture"**

- **Initial Plan:** Based on a general brief, we planned a standard foresight flow focusing on "Global Risks" (Climate, Digital) and linear trends.
    
- **The Change:** The deck revealed a specific philosophical stance: **"The Rupture"**. The core argument is that the continuity between Past, Present, and Future is broken.
    
- **Result:** The design now visually represents "broken bridges" and "snapped lines" instead of smooth trend curves. The tone shifted from "predicting the future" to "taking moral responsibility" for a broken timeline.
    

#### **2. The Strategic Framework: "Two Worlds" Logic**

- **Initial Plan:** We expected a general "Preferred Future" conclusion.
    
- **The Change:** The deck contained a specific **Strategic Matrix** contrasting two logics:
    
    - **Logic A:** "Forced Independence" (Risk is personal).
        
    - **Logic B:** "Supported Autonomy" (Risk is supported by system).
        
- **Result:** The presentation now culminates in a **"Sliding Doors" moment**—visualizing two parallel realities (The Trap vs. The Goal) rather than just a single optimistic vision.
    

#### **3. Visual Metaphor Refinement**

- **Act 1 (The Wake-Up Call):**
    
    - _Concept:_ **"The Flashlight in the Fog."**
        
    - _Why:_ Derived from the slide stating "Foresight is not prediction" but a tool to see hidden consequences. Visuals now use high-contrast beams of light cutting through darkness.
        
- **Act 2 (The Blueprints):**
    
    - _Concept:_ **"The Architects."**
        
    - _Why:_ The groups are not just presenting data; they are proposing structural fixes to the "Rupture." Visuals now use clean lines, blueprints, and construction motifs.
        
- **Act 3 (The Choice):**
    
    - _Concept:_ **"The Navigation Map."**
        
    - _Why:_ Based on the final questions asking "Which world are we building?". Visuals use clean grids and matrices to force a decision.
        

#### **4. Structural Optimization for Time**

- **Challenge:** The deck contained ~50 slides of detailed signals (Family, Learning, Risk) which is too much for a 15-minute slot.
    
- **Solution:** We compressed these into a single **"Great Divergence"** section. Instead of listing every signal, the design uses a "Split Screen" visual to show the _pattern_ across all domains: the split between "System-Dependent" (Stable) and "Person-Dependent" (Fragile) paths .
    

#### **5. Standardization of Group Identity**

- **The Change:** We mapped the 4 specific groups to distinct color codes and icon sets based on their "Right" :
    
    - **Survival:** Earth/Red (Vitality).
        
    - **Development:** Green (Growth).
        
    - **Participation:** Orange (Voice).
        
    - **Protection:** Blue (Shield).
        
- **Result:** A unified 5-slide template for all groups (System Map $\rightarrow$ Uncertainties $\rightarrow$ Scenarios $\rightarrow$ Vision $\rightarrow$ Strategy) ensuring the "Hero's Journey" narrative is consistent.
    

This retrospective confirms that the design has moved from a generic "professional deck" to a **bespoke narrative instrument** that directly amplifies Professor Ton's specific intellectual arguments.
