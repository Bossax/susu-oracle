Here are the specific Canva design specifications for **Act 1: 

Since the professor wants a "stage play" atmosphere where the slides are backdrops, the key is **"Cinematic Minimalism."** You are looking for high-contrast, moody visuals with very little text.

## Act 1: The Looming Storm

- **Mood:** Noir, Urgent, Heavy, Sophisticated.
- **Fonts (Thai & English Pairing):**
    - **Headline (Dramatic/Serif):** _Cormorant Garamond_ (Elegant, academic, serious) or _Pridi_ (Thai serif, feels grounded).
    - **Body/Subtext (Clean/Modern):** _Prompt_ (Modern, widely used for Thai/Eng foresight) or _Montserrat_.
        
- **Color Palette (The "Storm" Palette):**
    - **Background (The Void):** `#0F0F0F` (Rich Black) or `#1C2526` (Deep Midnight Green - suggests deep ocean/climate).
    - **Accent 1 (Urgency/Risk):** `#8B0000` (Dark Red/Crimson).
    - **Accent 2 (Technology/Digital):** `#2F4F4F` (Dark Slate Gray).
    - **Text:** `#E0E0E0` (Light Grey - never use pure white, it's too harsh for a dark room).

### **Slide 1: เกริ่นนำ (The Current Situation)**

**Concept:** The weight of the world. Visualizing the "Systemic Risk" and pressure on children.
- **Approximate Layout:**
    - **Full-bleed background image:** Covers 100% of the slide.
    - **Overlay:** A black "Gradient Fade" element from the bottom up to ensure text readability.
    - **Text:** Very small, centered at the very bottom or floating in "negative space" (empty sky/dark area). Just the topic title.
        
- **Canva Search Keywords (Photos):**
    - `"Dark moody storm clouds"`
    - `"Abstract tangled wires dark"` (Metaphor for systemic complexity)
    - `"Silhouette of child looking at big city"`
    - `"Double exposure pollution"`
        
- **Canva Elements (Graphics):**
    - `"Film grain overlay"` (Adds a cinematic, raw texture).
    - `"Vignette"` (Darkens edges to focus attention).
    - `"Fog effect"`

### **Slide 2: โอกาสในวิกฤต (Risk to Opportunity)**

**Concept:** The Pivot. Shifting the audience's gaze from the problem to the potential. "Flipping the script."

- **Approximate Layout:**
    - **Split Screen (Diagonal or Vertical):** One side is the heavy texture from Slide 1, the other is a sharp, clean light source.
    - **OR Single Focus:** A dark room with a single, sharp beam of light cutting through.
    - **Text:** A single word or short phrase (e.g., "From Risk... to Resilience") placed exactly where the light hits the dark.
        
- **Canva Search Keywords (Photos):**
    - `"Light ray in dark room"`
    - `"Crack in concrete with flower"`
    - `"Sunrise through dark clouds"`
    - `"Abstract light breakthrough"`
    - `"Gold kintsugi"` (The Japanese art of repairing with gold – perfect metaphor for broken systems becoming stronger).
        
- **Canva Elements (Graphics):**
    - `"Light leak overlay"`
    - `"Prism light effect"`
        

---

### **Slide 3: ปัจจัยขับเคลื่อน (Key Drivers)**

**Concept:** The Invisible Forces. Visualizing "Digital" and "Climate" not as separate lists, but as a massive, looming system.

- **Approximate Layout:**
    - **Background:** A large-scale, repetitive pattern that feels overwhelming but organized (like a hive or data stream).
    - **Foreground:** 3-4 large keywords (The Drivers) floating in the 3D space of the image. Use transparency on the text so the background shows through slightly.
        
- **Canva Search Keywords (Photos/Videos):**
    - `"Abstract data wave dark"`
    - `"Digital topography"`
    - `"Glacier texture dark"` (For climate driver).
    - `"Constellation network black background"`
    - `"Abstract mechanism gears dark"`
        
- **Canva Elements (Graphics):**
    - `"Cyberpunk grid"` (Use subtly with low transparency).
    - `"Tech lines overlay"`
        


Here are the design specifications for the **Transition Slides** and the **Group Title Cards**.

These slides act as "curtains" opening and closing scenes. They are crucial for signaling a shift in energy to the audience.

## Transition Slide: The Handover

**Context:** Moving from Prof. Ton’s "Global Gloom" (Act 1) to the Students’ "Action & Solutions" (Act 2).

**Concept:** _The Dawn / The Baton Pass._ We are leaving the storm and focusing on the people who will weather it.

**Color Strategy:** A gradient or blend. Moving from the Dark Grey/Black of Act 1 into a spectrum of light (White or Gold).

- **Approximate Layout:**
    - **Background:** A cinematic "fade from black." The left side is dark/shadowy, fading into bright light or a clear horizon on the right.
    - **Focus:** A singular, powerful human element connecting the two sides.
    - **Text:** Minimal. Something like "Voices of the Future" or "The Response." Centered, perhaps with a wide letter-spacing.
        
- **Canva Search Keywords (Photos):**
    - `"Hand passing baton silhouette"`
    - `"Silhouette people looking at sunrise"`
    - `"Light at the end of tunnel"`
    - `"Crowd of young people from back"` (facing the light)
    - `"Prism refracting light"` (symbolizing one issue breaking into 4 solutions)
        
- **Canva Elements:**
    - `"Gradient fade black to transparent"`
    - `"Particle dust overlay"` (floating dust motes in light beams)

## Act 2: The Hero's Journey (Group Presentations x4)

### **Group Intro Slide (The "Title Card")**

**Context:** Each group takes the stage (15 mins). This slide stays up while the team sets up or introduces themselves.

**Concept:** _The Movie Poster / Character Select._ It establishes the specific "Flavor" of the hero immediately.

**Layout:**

- **Poster Style:** Large, bold typography taking up 50% of the screen.
- **Hero Image:** A monochromatic or duotone image representing that specific right.
- **Iconography:** A large, semi-transparent icon in the background representing the domain.
