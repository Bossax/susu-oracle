# 1. Summary 

This document outlines the refined methodology for the Thailand Climate Risk Index (CRI). Building upon the Pilot Phase (2023), this framework addresses critical limitations regarding spatial resolution and data consistency.

**Core Strategic Shifts:**

1. **From "Total Damage" to "Fiscal Relief":** The economic component is explicitly redefined as a **Fiscal Relief Index**. It measures the burden on government emergency budgets (Relief Payments), rather than total physical economic loss. This aligns with available data reality. <!--todo: to be discussed-->
    
2. **"Constrained Redistribution" Approach:** To resolve the conflict between official administrative data and high-resolution global data, we apply a "Constrained Redistribution" method. Global datasets are used strictly to _spatially disaggregate_ official provincial/district totals, ensuring the final numbers match Ministry of Interior (DOPA) records exactly.
    
3. **Gap-Aware Calculation:** "Zero" values in the dataset are no longer automatically treated as "Low Risk." They are cross-referenced with hazard exposure layers to flag "Administrative Data Gaps."
    

## 2. The Equation Framework (Composite Index)

The CRI Score ($0-100$) is a composite of **Human Impact** and **Economic Impact**.

### 2.1 Weighting Structure

We retain the Germanwatch principle of equal weighting between Human and Economic dimensions but refine the sub-indicators to eliminate redundancy. <!--todo: to be discussed-->

|Dimension|Indicator|Weight|Rationale|
|---|---|---|---|
|**A. Human Impact**|**Fatalities & Affected (Relative)**|**50%**|Prioritizes impact per capita to ensure populous provinces don't skew the index simply due to size.|
|**B. Economic Impact**|**Fiscal Relief per Provincial GPP (Total)**|**50%**|Measures the _intensity_ of government financial strain relative to total provincial economic output (sector split not yet available).|

### 2.2 Refined Formulas ⚠️ to be discussed

#### A. Human Impact (Population Weighted)

Unlike the Pilot, which summed Absolute and Relative values (double counting), we prioritize **Relative Impact** for the index score, while retaining Absolute numbers for "Magnitude" visualization only.

$$Score_{Human} = \frac{Fatalities}{Population_{District}} \times W_1 + \frac{Affected}{Population_{District}} \times W_2$$


#### B. Economic Impact (Fiscal Relief–Based)

The economic pillar is explicitly defined as a **Fiscal Relief Index** rather than total economic loss. It uses **recorded public relief and emergency spending** as the numerator, recognizing that:

- Agricultural relief payments from the Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE) cover only a subset of affected land (typically up to 25 rai per farmer, as per current regulations).
- Central emergency funds (เงินทดรองราชการ) are broader than household compensation alone and may fund response and early recovery activities via line agencies.

We correct a core ambiguity from the Pilot by explicitly documenting the current denominator: **total provincial GPP (NESDC)** is used because sectoral GPP (agriculture vs non‑agriculture) is not yet available for all years. This introduces bias for provinces with low agricultural share, and will be refined once sector splits are obtained.

$$Score_{Economic} = \frac{Ag\_Relief\_Payment}{GPP_{Prov\_Total}}$$

> **Implication:** This is a **fiscal–response intensity** metric, not a complete damage estimate. Provinces with stronger reporting and more actively used relief channels may appear “higher risk” in fiscal terms even when private or uninsured losses are larger elsewhere.


> **Note on Urban/Industrial Risk:** Since relief payments for factories are rare/non-existent in this dataset, Urban Economic Risk is calculated via a separate **Exposure Proxy** (Commercial Land Use) rather than historical loss data.

## 3. Data Architecture: The "Hybrid" Model

We utilize a **Hybrid Data Model**. "Official Data" provides the _Magnitude_ (How much?), while "Global Data" provides the _Location_ (Where?).


> [!Attention] Data Lineage Note (TEI–DDPM–OAE, meeting 4 Feb 2026):
> - **Relief data** actually used in the TEI Pilot and in the current Phase 1 prototype comes from **OAE agricultural compensation (เงินเยียวยาเกษตรกร)**. There is **no monetary damage series from DDPM** in the index at this stage.
> - **Human‑impact data** (deaths and affected people) are sourced from DDPM, but these are used only in the Human Impact pillar, not as monetary loss.
> - **GPP denominator** currently refers to **total provincial GPP (NESDC)**, not agricultural GPP. This is a known bias until sectoral GPP can be separated.
> - For many provinces and years, **loss/relief values are missing**, not zero; TEI did **not** impute or fill gaps.
> - Bangkok and some industrial provinces have **casualty records** but very limited or no corresponding economic loss entries, especially outside agriculture.
> - **Agricultural relief** is recorded based on compensation rules (capped area per farmer), which underestimates actual damage in large events.
> - These characteristics justify treating the economic pillar as a **Fiscal Relief Index** and require explicit gap‑flagging (Section 6.1), instead of interpreting low values as low risk.

## 4. Technical Implementation: Dasymetric Mapping

To solve the "Coarse Resolution" pain point, we employ Binary Dasymetric Mapping.

### 4.1 Concept: "Constrained Redistribution"

We do not replace DOPA population numbers. We redistribute them.

**The Algorithm:** For a given District $D$ with Official Population $P_{official}$:

1. Extract WorldPop grid cells falling within District $D$.
    
2. Calculate the sum of WorldPop values in that district: $\sum WP_{cells}$.
    
3. Calculate the **Correction Factor (**$CF$**)**:
    
    $$CF = \frac{P_{official}}{\sum WP_{cells}}$$
4. Apply $CF$ to every pixel.
    
    $$Final\_Pop_{pixel} = WP_{pixel} \times CF$$

**Result:** A high-resolution population map where the sum of all pixels **exactly equals** the Ministry of Interior's official number.

### 4.2 Handling "Latent Population" 

In many economic zones (e.g., Rayong), Satellite Population ($WP$) will be significantly higher than Official Registration ($P_{official}$).

- **Action:** We calculate the residual ($WP - P_{official}$) and store it as a separate layer: **"Latent Population Risk Layer."**
    
- **Usage:** This layer is for _emergency response planning_ only, not for the core Fiscal Index (which relies on registered heads-count for budget allocation).
    

## 5. Economic Zoning & Urban Proxies

### 5.1 The Agricultural Filter

To accurately map economic loss, we intersect three layers:
1. **Agri-Map (LDD):** Defines _what_ the crop is (e.g., Rice vs. Rubber). This determines the "Economic Value per Rai."
    
2. **ESA WorldCover (ESA):** Defines _where_ the crop physically is (removing farm roads, houses, and forests from the LDD polygons).
    
3. **Flood/Drought Mask (GISTDA):** Defines _if_ it was hit. <!--todo:  to be decided-->
    

### 5.2 The "Bangkok" Fix

Bangkok and industrial estates often show "Zero Relief" despite high risk, ~~because factories rely on private insurance, not government handouts.~~

- **Proxy Variable:** For non-agricultural zones (Urban/Industrial), risk is defined by **Exposure**, not Historical Relief.
    
- **Data Source:** **Industrial GPP** (NESDC) weighted by **Commercial/Industrial Land Use** (ESA WorldCover class 50/60).
    

## 6. Data Quality & Limitations

### 6.1 The "Gap Flag" Protocol

A major flaw in the Pilot was treating "Missing Data" as "Zero Risk."

- **Protocol:** If `Hazard_Satellite = TRUE` AND `Relief_Official = 0`:
  - **Flag:** "Administrative Gap" (Pink Code).
  - **Action:** Exclude from the "Low Risk" ranking. Display as "Insufficient Data" on the map.

> [!attention]  Clarification from TEI (4 Feb 2026):
> TEI confirmed that in the pilot datasets, a value of `0` in many provincial records often means “no report received” rather than “no damage”. No statistical gap filling was applied. This reinforces the need to treat `0` + observed hazard as an **Administrative Gap**, not a low‑risk signal.

### 6.2 Definition of "Loss" and "Relief"

The CRI calculates **Fiscal Vulnerability**, not Total Economic Loss.

- _Excluded:_ Private insurance claims, unrealised opportunity costs, and most indirect supply‑chain disruptions.
- _Included:_ Direct government compensation payments (Kor-Or-Por/Vor-Por), central emergency funds (เงินทดรองราชการ) used for disaster response and early recovery, and agricultural relief payments recorded by OAE.

> [!Important]
>  In many pilot‑year files, the available “loss” variables are in fact **relief and emergency spending records**, not engineering damage assessments. Phase 1 therefore treats these as **fiscal response proxies**, and supplements them with exposure proxies in urban/industrial provinces where relief is structurally under‑reported.
