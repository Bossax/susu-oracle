# CRI – Resilience Measurement & Indicator Design (Synthesis)

This note summarizes key insights from AI_output reviews on resilience measurement to support the design choices in:

- [`CRI Phase 1 Methodology.md`](../output/CRI%20Phase%201%20Methodology.md)
- [`CRI Phase 2 Methodology.md`](../output/CRI%20Phase%202%20Methodology.md)

## 1. Trait vs Process vs Outcome

Sources:

- [`Approaches of resilience measurement.md`](Approaches%20of%20resilience%20measurement.md)
- [`Climate and disaster resilience measurement - Persistent gaps in multiple hazards, methods, and practicability.md`](Climate%20and%20disaster%20resilience%20measurement%20-%20Persistent%20gaps%20in%20multiple%20hazards%2C%20methods%2C%20and%20practicability.md)
- [`Process-Based and Governance-Oriented Frameworks for Measuring Climate Resilience - Consensus.AI.md`](Process-Based%20and%20Governance-Oriented%20Frameworks%20for%20Measuring%20Climate%20Resilience%20-%20Consensus.AI.md)

**Key points**

- Resilience approaches can be grouped into:
  - **System traits** – static characteristics and capacities.
  - **Processes** – governance, planning, and decision-making quality.
  - **Outcomes** – observed ability to withstand and recover from shocks.
- Reviews recommend combining process- and outcome-based perspectives rather than relying solely on trait indices.

**Implications for CRI**

- Phase 1 focuses on a **risk and impact index** (trait/outcome oriented) based on observed human and fiscal impacts.
- Phase 2 introduces a **capacity-oriented layer** that emphasizes process and governance indicators (e.g., planning quality, institutional arrangements) rather than only socio-economic stocks.

## 2. Limitations of Purely Quantitative Indices

Sources:

- [`The search for the perfect indicator Reflections on monitoring and evaluation of resilience for improved climate risk m.md`](The%20search%20for%20the%20perfect%20indicator%20Reflections%20on%20monitoring%20and%20evaluation%20of%20resilience%20for%20improved%20climate%20risk%20m.md)
- [`Approaches of resilience measurement.md`](Approaches%20of%20resilience%20measurement.md)

**Key points**

- Aggregated quantitative indicators can create **perverse incentives** (e.g., rewarding projects that protect wealthy areas because they maximize "assets saved").
- Many indices emphasize **absorptive and adaptive capacity**, but under-represent **transformative capacity** and governance quality.
- Process-based metrics are recommended to avoid "developing to the indicator" and to better capture how projects manage uncertainty.

**Implications for CRI**

- CRI should treat quantitative scores as **diagnostic tools**, not as decision rules.
- Phase 2 uses existing administrative indicators (LPA, Sustainable City) as proxies for processes, but explicitly communicates that these represent **structural readiness**, not guaranteed performance.

## 3. Process-Based Indicators and Governance

Sources:

- [`Process-Based and Governance-Oriented Frameworks for Measuring Climate Resilience - Consensus.AI.md`](Process-Based%20and%20Governance-Oriented%20Frameworks%20for%20Measuring%20Climate%20Resilience%20-%20Consensus.AI.md)
- [`Local Performance Assessment LPA - indicator list.md`](Local%20Performance%20Assessment%20LPA%20-%20indicator%20list.md)
- [`Sustainable City Assessment- DCCE.md`](Sustainable%20City%20Assessment-%20DCCE.md)

**Key points**

- Process-based frameworks evaluate:
  - Inclusivity and participation in planning.
  - Institutional learning and flexibility.
  - Collaboration and multi-actor governance.
- Many tools combine **expert judgment, participatory workshops, and structured rubrics** rather than relying only on survey data.

**Implications for CRI**

- Phase 2 reuses existing governance-related indicators (LPA, Sustainable City) and **tags** them as Coping, Adaptive, or Transformative capacity evidence.
- Site visits and qualitative assessments are needed to validate whether "plans on paper" are actually used; this is captured in the proposed **Gap Analysis Report** rather than in the index score itself.

## 4. Multi-Hazard and Systemic Risk Gaps

Sources:

- [`Climate and disaster resilience measurement - Persistent gaps in multiple hazards, methods, and practicability.md`](Climate%20and%20disaster%20resilience%20measurement%20-%20Persistent%20gaps%20in%20multiple%20hazards%2C%20methods%2C%20and%20practicability.md)

**Key points**

- Few existing tools integrate **multi-hazard** interactions or systemic risk.
- There is often a separation between traditional risk assessment (hazard × exposure × vulnerability) and resilience measurement.

**Implications for CRI**

- Phase 1 and Phase 2 should be designed as **complementary**: risk/impact indexing plus capacity/progress measurement.
- Future extensions can incorporate multi-hazard modeling and systemic risk modules once foundational data systems are in place.
