# **1. Current project health & priority**

**Stable, with high methodological leverage.** Phase 2 has a confirmed **SES-oriented pivot**: the project will deliver a national index while shifting emphasis from pure loss/risk ranking toward **Resilience Capacity Profiles** (Coping–Adaptive–Transformative). Following the **7 Jan 2026** Inception Report and the **4 Feb TEI data meeting**, the priority is to consolidate the **Fiscal Relief Index** and capacity-tagging design on a sound data foundation.

# **2. Near‑term focus (next 2–4 weeks)**

1. **Finalize Gap Analysis (WP2):** Operationalize the "Administrative Gap" flag by cross-checking DDPM/relief datasets with hazard layers; document where 0 = missing vs true zero.
2. **Clarify Fiscal Relief data architecture (WP2):** Map the full pipeline of central emergency funds and agricultural relief payments (TEI–DDPM–OAE) to ensure consistent definitions before index calculation.
3. **Build Impact Index prototype (WP3):** Implement the "Constrained Redistribution" population layer and first-cut Fiscal Relief Index at provincial level as a working prototype for internal review.
4. **Design Capacity Tagging library (WP3):** Translate LPA and Sustainable City indicators into Coping/Adaptive/Transformative tags and agree tagging rules with the adaptation team.
5. **Prepare consultation storyline:** Draft visual narratives (risk vs. capacity, SES framing) for the March technical consultation.

# **3. Key decisions & assumptions to remember**

- **SES framing is locked in:** CRI Phase 2 will focus on **Resilience Capacity (Coping–Adaptive–Transformative)**, not a generic "readiness" label or pure loss index.
- **Fiscal, not total loss:** The economic pillar is defined as a **Fiscal Relief Index** (government emergency and relief spending), distinct from total physical/economic loss.
- **Constrained Redistribution is non‑negotiable:** High‑resolution population and exposure layers must be constrained to match official DOPA totals to avoid institutional pushback.
- **Gap-aware protocol:** "0" in relief data cannot be assumed to mean "no risk"; administrative gaps must be explicitly flagged and excluded from "low risk" rankings.
- **Urban Blindspot requires proxies:** Bangkok and industrial provinces will be represented using **exposure proxies** (land use, industrial GPP) rather than agricultural relief alone.
- **Capacity data is primarily structural:** LPA and Sustainable City indicators are treated as **existence of mechanisms** (structural readiness), not proof of operational quality.

# **4. Imminent milestones & deadlines**

- **28 Feb 2026:** Deliver Gap Analysis Report, including treatment of zero vs missing data and TEI/DDPM/OAE data lineage summary.
- **Early Mar 2026:** Freeze first prototype of Fiscal Relief Impact Index (provincial level) and SES-based Capacity Profile design for internal review.
- **Mid Mar 2026:** First consultation workshop with DCCE/TEI (methodology, SES framing, and Capacity Profile concept).
- **Apr–May 2026:** Build pilot maps and provincial Capacity Profiles for 2–3 case provinces.

# **5. Short‑term risks & watchpoints**

- **Data definition misalignment:** Inconsistent definitions of "damage" and "relief" between DDPM, OAE and budget regulations could undermine the Fiscal Relief Index if not resolved early.
- **Residual data gaps:** Even with TEI support, some years/provinces may still have missing or inconsistent loss/relief data, affecting robustness of long‑term averages.
- **Stakeholder understanding of SES framing:** DCCE/TEI may need time to internalize the shift from a single risk ranking to multi-dimensional capacity profiles, risking miscommunication if not framed clearly.

# **6. Next sponsor/steering message**

- **Inception delivered:** The Inception Report was submitted on **7 Jan 2026**, confirming scope, work packages and the CRI Phase 2 SES pivot.
- **Data partnership active:** TEI has shared core CRI Pilot datasets and DDPM-linked loss/relief files; we are auditing definitions and gaps before committing to final formulas.
- **Methodology evolution:** CRI Phase 2 will separate **Impact (Fiscal Relief)** from **Resilience Capacity Profiles**, improving usefulness for local decision‑making beyond simple rankings.
- **Gap-aware and politically robust:** The combination of **Constrained Redistribution** and explicit **Administrative Gap** flags is designed to respect official statistics while correcting false "zero risk" impressions.
- **Upcoming consultation:** The March workshop will be used to test the SES framing and Capacity Profile visuals with DCCE/TEI and to confirm expectations for pilot provinces and data investment roadmap.
