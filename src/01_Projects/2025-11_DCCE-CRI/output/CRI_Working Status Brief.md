# 1. Current project health & priority

**Stable but Critical.** We are moving into the **Methodological Validation** phase. The priority is to confirm that the "Hybrid Data" approach (Constrained Redistribution) is acceptable to DCCE and stakeholders before mass production. We are simultaneously running the "Gap Analysis" to ensure we don't produce a "False Zero" map.

# 2. Near‑term focus (next 2–4 weeks)

1.  **Submit Inception Report:** Finalize and submit by **Jan 7**.
2.  **Gap Analysis & Data Flags (WP2):** Complete the cross-check of Relief Payments vs. Satellite Hazards to create the "Administrative Gap" flag layer.
3.  **Methodology Defense (WP2):** Write the technical note defending the use of WorldPop/ESA data as a *disaggregation tool* for official stats, not a replacement.
4.  **Preliminary Readiness Index (WP3):** Begin tagging the "Sustainable City" and "LPA" datasets to build the first draft of the Readiness/Capacity Index.
5.  **Data Acquisition:** Secure access to the raw "Relief Payment" databases from DOPA/Agriculture.

# 3. Key decisions & assumptions to remember

-   **"Constrained Redistribution" is Non-Negotiable:** To avoid political rejection, all high-res maps must sum exactly to official district totals.
-   **Fiscal Relief Index:** We are measuring *Government Response* (Fiscal), not total physical damage. This distinction must be clear.
-   **Binary Data Strategy:** We assume that aggregating multiple "Yes/No" administrative indicators will create enough variance for a meaningful Readiness Index.
-   **Urban Blindspot:** We must use "Commercial/Industrial Land Use" as a proxy for urban exposure, as agricultural relief data will miss these areas.

# 4. Imminent milestones & deadlines

-   **07 Jan 2026:** Submit Inception Report.
-   **28 Feb 2026:** Completion of Gap Analysis Report (WP2).
-   **March 2026:** First Consultation Workshop (Methodology & "Capacity Profile" concept).

# 5. Short‑term risks & watchpoints

-   **Data Access Delay:** If DOPA/Agencies delay sharing the raw relief microdata, WP2 (Gap Analysis) stalls.
-   **"False Zeros":** High risk that provinces with poor reporting appear "Low Risk." The "Gap Flag" protocol is the only defense.
-   **Methodology Rejection:** Stakeholders might still view satellite data as "foreign/unofficial" despite the constrained approach.

# 6. Next sponsor/steering message

-   **Inception Ready:** Project Inception Report is ready for submission (Jan 7).
-   **Problem Solved:** We have a solution for the "Data Conflict" risk: **Constrained Redistribution**. This allows us to use high-tech satellite data while matching official ministry numbers exactly.
-   **New Insight:** We are developing a **"Readiness Index"** using existing administrative data (LPA/Sustainable City) to show *why* some provinces cope better than others, not just *where* disaster strikes.
