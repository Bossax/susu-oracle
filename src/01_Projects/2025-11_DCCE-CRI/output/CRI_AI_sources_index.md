# CRI AI Evidence Index

This index links key AI_output research notes to specific questions in the CRI design and to the corresponding sections in the methodology documents:

- [`CRI Phase 1 Methodology.md`](../output/CRI%20Phase%201%20Methodology.md)
- [`CRI Phase 2 Methodology.md`](../output/CRI%20Phase%202%20Methodology.md)

## 1. Resilience Measurement & Indicator Design

**Guiding questions**

- How should we balance trait-based, process-based, and outcome-based resilience indicators?
- Why does Phase 2 emphasize process/governance indicators instead of only static stocks?

**Primary AI_output sources**

- [`Approaches of resilience measurement.md`](Approaches%20of%20resilience%20measurement.md)
- [`Process-Based and Governance-Oriented Frameworks for Measuring Climate Resilience - Consensus.AI.md`](Process-Based%20and%20Governance-Oriented%20Frameworks%20for%20Measuring%20Climate%20Resilience%20-%20Consensus.AI.md)
- [`The search for the perfect indicator Reflections on monitoring and evaluation of resilience for improved climate risk m.md`](The%20search%20for%20the%20perfect%20indicator%20Reflections%20on%20monitoring%20and%20evaluation%20of%20resilience%20for%20improved%20climate%20risk%20m.md)

**Linked methodology sections**

- Phase 2: Section 2 (Conceptual Framework: Coping/Adaptive/Transformative Capacity)
- Phase 2: Section 3 (Operational Methodology – Capacity Tagging)

## 2. Capacity Concepts: Coping vs Adaptive vs Transformative

**Guiding questions**

- How are coping, adaptive, and transformative capacity defined in current literature?
- What is the evidence that many indices conflate coping capacity with adaptive capacity?
- How does this justify the three-tier capacity model in Phase 2?

**Primary AI_output sources**

- [`Approaches of index development - concensus.md`](Approaches%20of%20index%20development%20-%20concensus.md)
- [`Coping vs Adaptive Capacity - Consensus.ai.md`](Coping%20vs%20Adaptive%20Capacity%20-%20Consensus.ai.md)
- [`Studies on adaptive capacity to climate change a synthesis of changing concepts, dimensions, and indicators.md`](Studies%20on%20adaptive%20capacity%20to%20climate%20change%20a%20synthesis%20of%20changing%20concepts%2C%20dimensions%2C%20and%20indicators.md)
- [`Climate Resilient Development (CRD).md`](Climate%20Resilient%20Development%20(CRD).md)

**Linked methodology sections**

- Phase 2: Section 2.1–2.3 (Coping, Adaptive, Transformative Capacity)
- Phase 2: Section 5 (Strategic Benefits of the Capacity Profile approach)

## 3. Historical Loss and Damage Estimation

**Guiding questions**

- How can DCCE estimate 30 years of disaster damage and loss with incomplete data?
- Why is a hybrid method (proxy data, remote sensing, modeling) recommended?
- How does this relate to the shift from "total damage" to a Fiscal Relief Index in Phase 1?

**Primary AI_output source**

- [`Estimating Historical Disaster Damage and Loss with Limited Data.md`](Estimating%20Historical%20Disaster%20Damage%20and%20Loss%20with%20Limited%20Data.md)

**Linked methodology sections**

- Phase 1: Section 1 (Summary – From total damage to Fiscal Relief Index)
- Phase 1: Section 3 (Data Architecture – Hybrid Model and Constrained Redistribution)
- Phase 1: Section 6 (Data Quality & Limitations)

## 4. Governance and Process-Based Resilience

**Guiding questions**

- What frameworks exist for assessing governance and process-based resilience at sub-national scales?
- How do these frameworks support the use of administrative indicators (LPA, Sustainable City) in CRI Phase 2?

**Primary AI_output source**

- [`Process-Based and Governance-Oriented Frameworks for Measuring Climate Resilience - Consensus.AI.md`](Process-Based%20and%20Governance-Oriented%20Frameworks%20for%20Measuring%20Climate%20Resilience%20-%20Consensus.AI.md)

**Linked methodology sections**

- Phase 2: Section 3 (Operational Methodology – Tagging Protocol)
- Phase 2: Section 4 (Output – Capacity Profiles and Gap Analysis)
