# CRI – Capacity Concepts (Coping, Adaptive, Transformative)

This note synthesizes key literature-based insights on capacity concepts that underpin the CRI Phase 2 three-tier capacity model.

## 1. Stock vs Process Critique of Adaptive Capacity

Sources:

- [`Approaches of index development - concensus.md`](Approaches%20of%20index%20development%20-%20concensus.md)
- [`Studies on adaptive capacity to climate change a synthesis of changing concepts, dimensions, and indicators.md`](Studies%20on%20adaptive%20capacity%20to%20climate%20change%20a%20synthesis%20of%20changing%20concepts%2C%20dimensions%2C%20and%20indicators.md)

**Key points**

- Many indices operationalize adaptive capacity using **static capital stocks** (income, education, infrastructure, etc.).
- Reviews show these indicators often measure **generic wealth or coping potential**, not the system's ability to learn, innovate, and transform.
- Newer work emphasizes **institutions, agency, governance, and knowledge systems** as core determinants of adaptive capacity.

**Implications for CRI**

- Phase 2 should not treat higher GDP or infrastructure density as automatically indicating higher resilience.
- The capacity model should explicitly incorporate governance, agency, and institutional dimensions, even when proxied by administrative indicators.

## 2. Coping vs Adaptive Capacity

Source:

- [`Coping vs Adaptive Capacity - Consensus.ai.md`](Coping%20vs%20Adaptive%20Capacity%20-%20Consensus.ai.md)

**Key points**

- **Coping capacity** relates to short-term, ex-post responses to shocks (response and early recovery).
- **Adaptive capacity** relates to medium- to long-term, ex-ante adjustments that address underlying risk drivers.
- The literature warns that many quantitative indicators conflate the two, using the same variables for both.

**Implications for CRI**

- Phase 2 separates indicators into tiers by **function in the DRM cycle**:
  - Coping: emergency budgets, relief mechanisms, early warning and response systems.
  - Adaptive: integration of climate into development plans, diversification, learning systems.

## 3. Transformative Capacity

Sources:

- [`Approaches of index development - concensus.md`](Approaches%20of%20index%20development%20-%20concensus.md)
- [`The Calculus of Socio-Ecological Resilience - The Climate Resilience Index Equation .md`](The%20Calculus%20of%20Socio-Ecological%20Resilience%20-%20The%20Climate%20Resilience%20Index%20Equation%20.md)
- [`Climate Resilient Development (CRD).md`](Climate%20Resilient%20Development%20(CRD).md)

**Key points**

- Transformative capacity refers to the ability to **change system structures, goals, or pathways** when incremental adjustment is insufficient.
- It spans practical (technological/behavioural), political (institutional/power structures), and personal (values/worldviews) spheres.
- It is rarely operationalized in indices because of **data and conceptual gaps**.

**Implications for CRI**

- Phase 2 includes a Transformative capacity tier that can draw on proxies such as:
  - Land use planning reform and enforcement.
  - Participation in innovation or "smart city" programmes.
  - Long-term strategic planning processes that explicitly consider climate limits.

## 4. Application in CRI Phase 2

The CRI Phase 2 methodology translates these concepts into a practical **capacity tagging** protocol:

- LPA and Sustainable City indicators are mapped to Coping, Adaptive, and Transformative functions.
- Composite scores are interpreted as **structural readiness** in each tier, not as definitive performance.
- Radar-chart profiles visualize imbalances (e.g., strong coping but weak transformative capacity) to guide policy dialogue.
