# 1. Strategic Context: Balancing Rigor and Reality

The objective of CRI Phase 2 is to deliver a policy-relevant tool for local decision-makers (municipalities/provinces) while adhering to the Terms of Reference (TOR) which mandates a "National Index."

We recognize a spectrum of implementation approaches:

1. **Universal Comparability (The "Technocratic" End):** Standardized, asset-based indices (e.g., Germanwatch). Easy to rank, but often lacks local context and actionable insight.
    
2. **Context Specificity (The "Local" End):** Deep, process-based qualitative assessments (e.g., interviews, participatory workshops). Highly actionable, but impossible to scale to 76 provinces within the 8-month timeline.
    

**The Strategy:** We adopt a **"Middle Path."** We will deliver the standardized index required by the TOR, but we will restructure its internal logic to reflect rigorous Social-Ecological System (SES) principles. We will not collect new primary data for all provinces; instead, we will apply a novel **"Capacity Tagging"** framework to existing national datasets.

# 2. Conceptual Framework: Defining the Capacities

To transition DCCE from a "Disaster Management" mindset to a "Resilience" mindset, we establish three distinct tiers of capacity. These will form the sub-indices of the CRI.

## 2.1 Coping Capacity 

- **Concept:** The ability to withstand immediate shocks using _existing_ resources without changing the system.
- **Bureaucratic Translation:** Emergency Management & Relief.
    
- **Key Metrics (Existing Data):**
    - Emergency Budget reserves (งบกลาง/ฉุกเฉิน).
    - Disaster relief equipment stocks (Boats, pumps, shelters).
    - Early warning system coverage.
        

## 2.2 Adaptive Capacity

- **Concept:** The ability to learn and adjust processes to changing baselines to maintain the current trajectory.
    
- **Bureaucratic Translation:** Development Planning & Resource Allocation.
    
- **Key Metrics (Existing Data):**
    
    - Existence of Provincial Development Plans (แผนพัฒนาจังหวัด) integrating climate.
        
    - Education levels and technical training programs.
        
    - Healthcare system reach and flexibility.
        
    - Agricultural diversification rates.
        

## 2.3 Transformative Capacity (The "Evolution")

- **Concept:** The ability to fundamentally restructure the system when the status quo is untenable.
    
- **Bureaucratic Translation:** Structural Reform & Long-term Strategy.
    
- **Key Metrics (Existing Data):**
    
    - Land Use Planning enforcement (ผังเมือง) - e.g., restricting build zones.
        
    - Innovation budgets or "Smart City" pilot participation.
        
    - Cross-jurisdictional governance mechanisms (Are agencies working together?).
        

> **Educational Goal:** We use the Index to teach DCCE that _Coping_ is necessary but insufficient. True resilience requires _Adaptive_ and _Transformative_ scores.

# 3. Operational Methodology: The "Tagging" Protocol

Since creating new data streams is outside the scope/timeline, we will execute a **Systematic Categorization** of available administrative data.

## Step 1: Data Inventory & Review

We will compile datasets from all relevant line agencies. Key sources include:

- **DOPA (Department of Provincial Administration):** Local Performance Assessment (LPA) data.
    
- **DCCE (Dept of Climate Change and Environment):** Sustainable City Assessment indicators.
    
- **NESDC:** Socio-economic development data.
    
- **Interior Ministry:** Budgetary and planning records.
    

## Step 2: The "Capacity Tagging" Process

We will filter and "tag" each indicator based on its functional role in the SES framework:

- _Example 1:_ "Does the province have an emergency broadcast tower?" $\rightarrow$ Tag: **Coping Capacity**.
    
- _Example 2:_ "Does the local development plan mention 'Climate Change'?" $\rightarrow$ Tag: **Adaptive Capacity**.
    
- _Example 3:_ "Has the province revised its zoning map in the last 5 years?" $\rightarrow$ Tag: **Transformative Capacity**.
    

## Step 3: Addressing Data Quality (The "Binary" Challenge)

**Challenge:** Much of the administrative data (specifically LPA) is **Binary (Yes/No)** or check-box based. It measures the _existence_ of a mechanism, not its _quality_.

- _Mitigation:_ We will aggregate these binary indicators to create **Composite Scores**.
    
    - _Logic:_ A province with 8 out of 10 "Adaptive" mechanisms present has higher potential than one with 2.
        
    - _Transparency:_ We will explicitly communicate to DCCE that this measures "Structural Readiness" (existence of mechanisms), not necessarily "Operational Excellence."
        

# 4. The Output: Policy-Relevant Visualization

To avoid the "Ranking Trap" where officials simply look for who is #1, we will change the visualization strategy.

## 4.1 From "Single Rank" to "Capacity Profile"

Instead of a single map, we will produce **Radar Charts (Spider Webs)** for each province.

- **Axes:** Coping, Adaptive, Transformative, Ecosystem Health (Natural Capital).
    
- **Insight:**
    
    - _Scenario A:_ High Coping / Low Transformative $\rightarrow$ "This province is good at fighting fires but is not preventing them. **Recommendation:** Invest in Land Use Planning."
        
    - _Scenario B:_ High Transformative / Low Coping $\rightarrow$ "This province has great long-term plans but is vulnerable to immediate shocks. **Recommendation:** Increase Emergency Reserves."
        

## 4.2 The "Data Investment Roadmap"

We acknowledge that current data is imperfect. Therefore, a key deliverable of Phase 2 is not just the Index, but a **Gap Analysis Report**.

- **Site Visit Role:** We will use the pilot site visits to validate the "Binary vs. Reality" gap.
    
    - _Task:_ Interview officials to see if the "Climate Plan" (marked 'Yes' in the database) is actually used or just sits on a shelf.
        
- **Final Output:** A "Roadmap for National Data Collection" recommending which _process-based_ indicators DCCE should invest in collecting next to move from "Quantity" to "Quality."
    

# 5. Strategic Benefits of this Approach

1. **TOR Compliance:** We deliver the "National Index" and "Database" as promised.
    
2. **Feasibility:** We rely on _available_ data, mitigating the risk of scope creep or timeline failure.
    
3. **Educational Value:** The structure of the index itself educates the client on the hierarchy of resilience (Coping < Adaptive < Transformative).
    
4. **Policy Utility:** The "Capacity Profiles" give specific, actionable direction to local governors, moving beyond simple risk identification.
