# Disaster risk management

==Disaster risk management is the application of **disaster risk reduction** policies and strategies to prevent new disaster risk, reduce existing disaster risk and manage residual risk, contributing to the strengthening of resilience and reduction of disaster losses.==


**Annotation:** Disaster risk management actions can be distinguished between prospective disaster risk management, corrective disaster risk management and compensatory disaster risk management, also called residual risk management.

- **Prospective disaster risk management** activities address and seek to **avoid the development of new or increased disaster risks.** They focus on addressing disaster risks that may develop in future if disaster risk reduction policies are not put in place. Examples are better land-use planning or disaster-resistant water supply systems.
- **Corrective disaster risk management** activities address and seek to **remove or reduce disaster risks which are already present and which need to be managed and reduced now**. Examples are the retrofitting of critical infrastructure or the relocation of exposed populations or assets.
- **Compensatory disaster risk management** activities **strengthen the social and economic resilience** of individuals and societies in the face of residual risk that cannot be effectively reduced. They include preparedness, response and recovery activities, but also a  mix of different financing instruments, such as national contingency funds, contingent credit, insurance and reinsurance and social safety nets.
- **Community-based disaster risk management** promotes the involvement of potentially affected communities in disaster risk management at the local level. This includes community assessments of hazards, vulnerabilities and capacities, and their involvement in planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of local action for disaster risk reduction.
- **Local and indigenous peoples’ approach to disaster risk management** is the recognition and use of traditional, indigenous and local knowledge and practices to complement scientific knowledge in disaster risk assessments and for the planning and implementation of local disaster risk management.
- ==**Disaster risk management** *plans* set out the goals and specific objectives for reducing disaster risks together with related actions to accomplish these objectives==. They should be guided by the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015‑2030 and considered and coordinated within relevant development plans, resource allocations and programme activities. National-level plans need to be specific to each level of administrative responsibility and adapted to the different social and geographical circumstances that are present. ==The time frame and responsibilities for implementation and the sources of funding should be specified in the plan.== **Linkages to sustainable development and climate change adaptation plans should be made where possible.**

# Disaster risk reduction

- Disaster risk reduction is aimed at preventing new and reducing existing disaster risk and managing residual risk, all of which contribute to strengthening resilience and therefore to the achievement of sustainable development.

- **Annotation:** Disaster risk reduction is the policy objective of disaster risk management, and its goals and objectives are defined in disaster risk reduction strategies and plans.

- **Disaster risk reduction strategies and policies** define goals and objectives across different timescales and with concrete targets, indicators and time frames. In line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, these should be aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening of economic, social, health and environmental resilience.

- A global, agreed policy of disaster risk reduction is set out in the United Nations endorsed Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, adopted in March 2015, whose expected outcome over the next 15 years is: “The substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries”.
#  Resilience
- The ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate, adapt to, transform and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions through risk management. 


# Preparedness
- The knowledge and capacities developed by governments, response and recovery organizations, communities and individuals to effectively *anticipate*, *respond* to and *recover* from the impacts of likely, imminent or current disasters.
- **Annotation**: Preparedness action is carried out within the context of **disaster risk management** and aims to build the capacities needed to efficiently manage all types of emergencies and achieve orderly transitions from response to sustained recovery.
- Preparedness is based on a sound analysis of disaster risks and good linkages with early warning systems, and includes such activities as contingency planning, the stockpiling of equipment and supplies, the development of arrangements for coordination, evacuation and public information, and associated training and field exercises. These must be supported by formal institutional, legal and budgetary capacities. ==The related term “**readiness**” describes the ability to quickly and appropriately respond when required.==

- ==A **preparedness plan** establishes arrangements in advance to enable timely, effective and appropriate responses to specific potential hazardous events or emerging disaster situations that might threaten society or the environment.==

<!--note: Preparedness is a whole picture of disaster risk management. It focuses on knowledge and capacities needed for the whole DRM cycle, from anticipation to recovery-->

<!--note:  Readiness is more action-oriented. It focuses on the 'response' phase of DRM. Good readiness implies good response-->
# Capacity

The combination of all the **strengths, attributes and resources** available within an organization, community or society to **manage and reduce disaster risks and strengthen resilience**.

**Annotation:** Capacity may include infrastructure, institutions, human knowledge and skills, and collective attributes such as social relationships, leadership and management.

**Coping capacity** is the ability of people, organizations and systems, using available skills and resources, to manage adverse conditions, risk or disasters. ==The capacity to cope requires **continuing awareness, resources and good management, both in normal times as well as during disasters or adverse conditions**==. Coping capacities contribute to the reduction of disaster risks.

**Capacity assessment** is the process by which the capacity of a group, organization or society is reviewed against desired goals, where existing capacities are identified for maintenance or strengthening and capacity gaps are identified for further action.

**Capacity development** is the process by which people, organizations and society systematically stimulate and develop their capacities over time to achieve social and economic goals. It is a concept that extends the term of capacity-building to encompass all aspects of creating and sustaining capacity growth over time. It involves learning and various types of training, but also continuous efforts to develop institutions, political awareness, financial resources, technology systems and the wider enabling environment.
# Response

Actions taken directly before, during or immediately after a disaster in order to save lives, reduce health impacts, ensure public safety and meet the basic subsistence needs of the people affected.

**Annotation**: Disaster ==response is predominantly focused on immediate and short-term needs and is sometimes called disaster relief.== Effective, efficient and timely response relies on disaster risk-informed preparedness measures, including the development of the response capacities of individuals, communities, organizations, countries and the international community.

The institutional elements of response often include the provision of emergency services and public assistance by public and private sectors and community sectors, as well as community and volunteer participation. “Emergency services” are a critical set of specialized agencies that have specific responsibilities in serving and protecting people and property in emergency and disaster situations. They include civil protection authorities and police and fire services, among many others. The division between the response stage and the subsequent recovery stage is not clear-cut. Some response actions, such as the supply of temporary housing and water supplies, may extend well into the recovery stage.


#  Residual risk
The disaster risk that remains in unmanaged form, even when effective disaster risk reduction measures are in place, and for which emergency response and recovery capacities must be maintained.

**Annotation**: ==The presence of residual risk implies a continuing need to develop and support effective capacities for emergency services, preparedness, response and recovery,== together with socioeconomic policies such as safety nets and risk transfer mechanisms, as part of a holistic approach.

# Recovery
The restoring or improving of livelihoods and health, as well as economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets, systems and activities, of a disaster-affected community or society, aligning with the principles of sustainable development and “build back better”, to avoid or reduce future disaster risk.
# Build back better
The use of the recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction phases after a disaster **to increase the resilience of nations and communities through integrating disaster risk reduction measures into the restoration** of physical infrastructure and societal systems, and into the revitalization of livelihoods, economies and the environment.
