## Tag: review

“Out of the 175 publications, 44.57% (n = 78) applied quantitative methods,” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=3&annotation=4NLAVH63))

*Most literature focuses on community levels*


“The central question in adaptive capacity research revolves around identifying the factors that determine a household’s adaptive capacity.” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=4&annotation=ZB5YBM34)) unit of analysis is important

“The first category of studies exclusively relies on the **Sustainable Livelihood Framework (SLF)**, offering a research approach to evaluate diverse livelihood asset” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=4&annotation=QD7952LF))

“second category of research predominantly adopts a modified SLF” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=4&annotation=W8UC5IZH))

“third category of studies deviates from the SLF and introduces alternative dimensions. For instance, Gupta et al. (2010) emphasized the importance of institutions” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=4&annotation=JYXWB5YT))

“Gupta et al. (2010) played a major role in reshaping its research by placing “institutions”” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=4&annotation=6V7I5QKI))

“Cinner et al. (2018) emphasized the significance of “agency” as a key determinant” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=4&annotation=R4WMI2S4))

“Initially, livelihood assets were considered as the primary determinant but later institutions and agencies were identified as the critical determinants of adaptive capacity.” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=4&annotation=Z38BQVDK))

“Scholars most often used quantitative methods with statistical analysis for large-scale comparison and ranking of the adaptive capacity of multiple countries (Brooks et al. 2005; Siders 2019).” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=4&annotation=KTGISE67))

“qualitative method is gradually increasing, primarily to explore the specific vulnerability and capacity context of individual communities” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=4&annotation=72PIWU9U)) qualitative for community level

“it is fundamentally a measurement of latent response capacity to climate change and related disasters” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=6&annotation=SNRM9G9T))

“However, for effective adaptation action, people must have the decision-making power, willingness to act, and freedom to mobilize those components.” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=7&annotation=PY7QBPDG))

“The quantitative analysis method has limitations in effectively capturing how communities and farmers adapt, their capacity to adapt, and potential maladaptive practices.” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=8&annotation=8E5HBNDW))

## Tag: adaptive capacity

“Adaptive capacity represents a system’s ability to mobilize resources in response to stresses and shocks, constituting an invaluable latent attribute.” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=2&annotation=5JWXYJ5Y))

“adaptive capacity emerges as a positive attribute of a system that can lessen the vulnerability associated with climate change (Engle 2011)” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=2&annotation=3LLFMFES))

“Adaptive capacity encompasses a range of factors, including economic resources, technology, information and skills, infrastructure, institutions, and social factors that enable adaptation (IPCC 2014).” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=2&annotation=SBBGIIG6))

“Adaptive capacity is assessed primarily concerning climate change. Previously, it was termed as a coping capacity (IPCC 2001)” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=4&annotation=BQS6YZD5))

“system’s flexibility to better cope with stresses (Adger and Agnew 2004), resource management and mobilization (Armitage 2005; Nelson et al. 2007), tools to manage risk (Wall and Marzall 2006), resilience and capacity to adjust to change (IPCC 2007), and a system’s ability to manage exposure and sensitivity (Preston and Stafford-Smith 2009).” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=4&annotation=RR3H4BZG))

## Tag: early2000s

“In 2001, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognized adaptive capacity as a critical component of vulnerability” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=2&annotation=22HDB8WD))

“adaptive capacity comprises both biophysical and socio-economic factors that enhance human capability to adapt to and recover from the adverse impacts of climate change (Engle 2011)” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=2&annotation=BZJBNP7K))

“exposure refers to the condition of individuals, infrastructure, housing, production capacities, and tangible human assets situated in areas prone to hazards” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=2&annotation=TK7YZ86N))

“Sensitivity reflects the degree to which people rely on affected resources” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=2&annotation=YTAUGDPN))

## Tag: 2010s

Adaptive capacity includes
“responsive capacity of a social actor (Gupta et al. 2010), the latent potential of socio-ecological systems (Engle 2011), the ability of systems, institutions, humans, and organisms to adjust (IPCC 2014), the willingness and ability to translate available resources into effective adaptation action (Cinner et al. 2018).” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=4&annotation=3VBPENUN))


“adaptive capacity comprises both biophysical and socio-economic factors that enhance human capability to adapt to and recover from the adverse impacts of climate change (Engle 2011)” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=2&annotation=BZJBNP7K))
## Tag: 2020s

“Adaptive capacity refers to the ability of social-ecological systems to adapt to, navigate, and recover from the impacts of environmental change (Vallury et al. 2022).” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=4&annotation=I5W3FVTH))

## Tag: methodology

“Scholars often describe accessible natural resources as natural assets in areas where households utilize those resources for livelihood activities. Physical assets encompass fundamental personal or communal infrastructures, facilities, and tools essential for carrying out livelihood activities. Financial assets refer to available and accessible wealth crucial for investing in livelihood activities (Choden et al. 2020; Nawrotzki 2012; Williges et al. 2017). Human assets encompass the knowledge, skills, working capacity, and health status of household members required to achieve livelihood objectives. Social assets include networks, group memberships, trust, and relationships as integral aspects of social life (Chepkoech et al. 2020; DFID 1999).” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=6&annotation=2DMS4X6Y))

“econd category within adaptive capacity scholarship adopts a modified SLF as its research outline. In this group, scholars introduce additional dimensions to the SLF, addressing criticisms that the original form of SLF overlooks critical determinants of adaptive capacity, such as innovation, technology, information, and governance.” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=6&annotation=CGE398V4))

“Gupta et al. (2010) identified dimensions such as variety, learning capacity, room for autonomous change, leadership, resources, and fair governance, utilizing a unique approach with 22 indicators arranged in an adaptive capacity wheel. This approach is different from the conventional asset-based method for assessing adaptive capacity” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=6&annotation=9VGPANCI))

“However, critiques have emerged that the SLF overlooks crucial components of adaptive capacity beyond the asset base and this framework may not be sufficient to comprehensively assess the entire spectrum of it. In response to these critiques in subsequent years, scholars have expanded the framework’s scope, acknowledging knowledge, information, institutions, agency, diversity and flexibility, infrastructure, services, and governance as significant determinants of adaptive capacity.” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=6&annotation=DFJRZGY7))

“The scholars who fundamentally used the SLF argue that increased livelihood assets would enhance the adaptive capacity.” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=6&annotation=FVY25IXK))

“proximity to the road-head impact people’s mobility and thereby enhance access to the market, financial institutions, and healthcare facilities, as well as relevant information on farm input, technology, and training” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=7&annotation=K5DQ5ZC3))

“proximity and accessibility to healthcare facilities are also critical indicators of human capital” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=7&annotation=L3RNEK6Y))

## Tag: inequality

“Access to natural, financial, and societal resources is influenced by factors such as gender, class, race, age, physical ability, and educational level. However, there has been insufficient focus on improving equity in resource access (Abedin et al. 2019).” ([Chapagain et al., 2025, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/IZBQ4BLI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LEL9LIAD?page=7&annotation=9KYANG93))
