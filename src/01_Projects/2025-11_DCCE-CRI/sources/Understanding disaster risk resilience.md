## What is resilience?

Resilience is about anticipating, planning and reducing disaster risk to effectively protect persons, communities and countries, their livelihoods, health, cultural heritage, socio-economic assets and ecosystems. The ideas of ‘bounce back’, ‘spring forward’ and ‘build back better’ are often used in the context of resilience.

Resilience is related to ‘[capacity](https://www.preventionweb.net/risk/capacity)’ and ‘coping capacity’ and often understood as follows:

- ==Resilience: the ability to flourish in the face of disaster risk==
- ==Capacity: strengths and resources available to anticipate, cope with, resist and recover from disasters==
- ==Coping capacity: the ability to face and manage disasters==

Resilience is a term shared by many disciplines (e.g. psychology, engineering and ecology) and has been used in disaster studies since the 1970s. ==For many specialists, resilience is believed to be the opposite of [vulnerability](https://www.preventionweb.net/risk/vulnerability) and, likewise, similar to capacity, while others view capacities more as attributes of individuals and households and resilience as the coming together of capacities with the social, institutional and informational services that enable their effective use==. Resilience also emphasizes the importance of not only effectively managing change but also improving well-being in the face of multiple risks and shocks.

## Why does resilience matter?

The emphasis on resilience has emerged from the need to identify principles and measures to protect development gains from shocks and stresses. Owing to this need, resilience is an agenda shared by those concerned with disaster, financial, political, conflict and climate threats to development. The aim of resilience programming is, therefore, to ensure that shocks and stresses [do not lead to a long-term downturn in development progress](https://cdn.odi.org/media/documents/7552.pdf).

Similar to vulnerability, resilience can be discussed in terms of types; for instance economic, social, health, cultural and environmental resilience, which helps us to understand the different components of resilience. In the case of economic resilience, for example, a country’s resilience depends, to an important extent, on whether a government is able to absorb financial losses. However, enhancing resilience requires implementing strategies that account for all the types of resilience so as not to enhance one component at the expense of another.
