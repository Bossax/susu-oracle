# Process-Based Resilience Indicators

From a public policy perspective, process-based resilience indicators represent a shift away from measuring static traits (such as existing infrastructure stock) toward evaluating the quality of actions, interventions, and decision-making frameworks. Unlike outcome-based metrics, which assess the final state of a system (e.g., "avoided losses"), process-based metrics assess whether the mechanisms used to achieve resilience are robust, flexible, and inclusive.[^1][^2]


These indicators are designed to capture the "quality of climate risk screening and management" rather than just aggregated outputs[^2]. For example, instead of simply counting the number of beneficiaries of a project (an outcome), a process-based metric might evaluate whether the project design utilized a range of climate models to "stress test" the investment against future uncertainty.[^1]

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Focus on Intangibles:** These indicators are essential for measuring subjective but critical aspects of community resilience, such as governance, voice, empowerment, and social capital, which are difficult to quantify through traditional economic metrics.[^1]
- **Dynamic Nature:** While static indicators often rely on pre-disaster conditions (e.g., census data), process-based indicators attempt to capture the dynamic interactions and adaptive capacities that occur during and after a shock.[^3]
- **Avoidance of Perverse Incentives:** By focusing on the quality of the process, these metrics reduce the risk of "developing to the indicator"—a phenomenon where authorities might choose sub-optimal projects (like protecting wealthy areas to maximize "asset value saved") simply to satisfy a quantitative outcome target.[^1]

## Obtaining Process-Based Indicators
Obtaining these indicators requires different methodological approaches than standard quantitative data collection. It often necessitates a hybrid approach that combines raw data with qualitative expert judgment and participatory engagement.

**1. Expert Grading and Technical Standards** A prominent method for obtaining process-based indicators is the "Technical Resilience Grading Standard" (TResGS), used in frameworks like the Flood Resilience Measurement for Communities (FRMC).
- **Methodology:** This approach mirrors risk engineering practices in the insurance sector. It involves collecting raw data through mixed methods (household surveys, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews).
- **Grading:** Trained experts then use this raw data to assign a grade (e.g., A to D) to specific "sources of resilience" based on standardized definitions.
- **Application:** This method is particularly effective for grading subjective sources of resilience, such as "trust" or "feeling safe." Research indicates that grading these subjective concepts relies heavily on expert judgment to interpret the raw data, whereas objective financial indicators (e.g., savings rates) can be graded more directly from data.

**2. Participatory Workshops and Stakeholder Engagement** Obtaining valid process indicators often requires the direct involvement of practitioners and community members to validate that the indicators reflect local realities.

- **Co-creation:** In the development of urban resilience indicators, workshops with city representatives and consultants allow for cross-validation. This ensures that indicators capture the actual administrative processes and governance structures (e.g., the existence of inter-office working groups on climate change) rather than just theoretical best practices.
- **Contextualization:** Because resilience is highly context-specific, obtaining these indicators often involves filtering global indicator sets through local surveys to determine which processes are relevant for a specific municipality (e.g., in some contexts, "voter turnout" may not be a valid proxy for civil society engagement).

**3. Qualitative Process Evaluation** To measure the "transformative capacity" of a system—its ability to fundamentally change in response to a crisis—data collection must go beyond static snapshots. This requires longitudinal studies or qualitative assessments that track decision-making processes over time, ensuring that the system is not just "bouncing back" but adapting. This often involves assessing whether projects have established a "theory of change" that logically links interventions to resilience gains.
