# **Process-Based and Governance-Oriented Frameworks for Measuring Climate Resilience at Sub-National and Sectoral Levels**

## 1. Introduction

Measuring climate resilience at sub-national (city/district) and sectoral levels has evolved from static, asset-based indices toward more nuanced, process-based and governance-oriented frameworks. These approaches aim to capture not only the presence of resources (coping capacity) but also the quality of planning, institutional learning, adaptive management (adaptive capacity), and the ability to fundamentally transform systems when needed (transformative capacity) (Manyena et al., 2019; Gupta et al., 2010; Sharifi, 2016; Werners et al., 2021). Key methodologies such as the Adaptive Capacity Wheel, DRIFT, Tandem, and participatory frameworks like CRiSTAL and FRMC have been developed to assess these "soft" attributes—such as inclusivity, flexibility, foresight, and decision-making under uncertainty—moving beyond simple benchmarking toward tools that support ongoing improvement and learning (Manyena et al., 2019; Gupta et al., 2010; Daniels et al., 2020; Sharifi, 2016). This review synthesizes leading frameworks, their operationalization of adaptive and transformative capacities, and their orientation toward decision support versus ranking.

## 2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus—including Semantic Scholar, PubMed, and other sources—using targeted queries on process-based resilience indicators, adaptive/transformative capacity assessment tools, climate resilience maturity models, adaptive management metrics, and governance quality in disaster risk reduction (DRR). In total, 900 papers were identified; after screening for relevance and quality, 419 were screened further. Of these, 214 met eligibility criteria based on direct relevance to sub-national or sectoral climate resilience measurement. The final review includes the top 50 most relevant papers.

|Identification|Screening|Eligibility|Included|
|---|---|---|---|
|900|419|214|50|

**Figure 2:** Search strategy flow: identification to inclusion of key literature. Twenty unique searches were executed across eight search groups targeting foundational frameworks, operationalization of adaptive/transformative capacity, critiques of indicator approaches, and practical tools for city/sectoral application.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Process-Oriented Frameworks: Methodologies & Soft Attribute Scoring

Several prominent frameworks move beyond asset-counting to evaluate planning quality, institutional learning, inclusivity, flexibility, and decision-making under uncertainty:

- **Adaptive Capacity Wheel**: Assesses institutions on six dimensions—variety (diversity), learning capacity (institutional learning), room for autonomous change (flexibility), leadership, resource availability, fair governance—using 22 qualitative criteria (Gupta et al., 2010). It is widely used to score "soft" attributes such as inclusivity in decision-making processes.
- **DRIFT (Disaster Resilience Integrated Framework for Transformation)**: Distinguishes between preventive, anticipative, absorptive, adaptive, and transformative capacities; explicitly unpacks processes critical for theorizing/operationalizing resilience (Manyena et al., 2019).
- **Tandem Framework**: Focuses on co-designing transdisciplinary knowledge integration processes; emphasizes collaboration quality and institutional capacity-building as core elements of resilience (Daniels et al., 2020).
- **FRMC (Flood Resilience Measurement for Communities)**: Combines quantitative indicators with participatory self-assessment to capture social capital, governance quality, community engagement (Sharifi, 2016).
- **CRiSTAL**: A participatory tool that guides users through a structured process to identify local vulnerabilities/adaptive strategies; scores inclusivity by tracking stakeholder involvement in planning (Sharifi, 2016).

These tools often use mixed methods—combining checklists or scoring rubrics with workshops or interviews—to assess how well cities/sectors plan adaptively under uncertainty (Daniels et al., 2020; Manyena et al., 2019; Gupta et al., 2010; Sharifi, 2016).

### 3.2 Operationalizing Transformative Capacity

Frameworks increasingly distinguish transformative capacity from coping/adaptive capacities:

- **DRIFT**: Defines transformative capacity as the ability to fundamentally alter system structures when incremental adaptation is insufficient; includes indicators for foresight (anticipating future risks), innovation testing (piloting new approaches), challenging path dependency (overcoming institutional inertia) (Manyena et al., 2019).
- **Capacities for Transformative Climate Governance**: Proposes four governance capacities—stewarding (anticipation/recovery), unlocking (reducing unsustainability), transformative (creating/embedding innovation), orchestrating (synergy/trade-off management)—with explicit focus on transformation dynamics (Hölscher, 2020).
- **Transition Management & Adaptive Management**: Emphasize experimentation ("living labs"), scenario planning under deep uncertainty ("dynamic adaptation policy pathways"), stakeholder co-production of solutions (Reed et al., 2013; Ringsmuth et al., 2022; Quay, 2010).

Transformative indicators include measures of institutional openness to change; frequency/effectiveness of innovation pilots; mechanisms for learning from failure; integration of long-term scenario analysis into planning cycles (Manyena et al., 2019; Werners et al., 2021; Hölscher, 2020).

### 3.3 Planning vs. Ranking Orientation

A key distinction is between frameworks designed for benchmarking/ranking versus those supporting ongoing improvement:

- **Decision Support/M&E Tools**: Most process-based frameworks prioritize iterative self-assessment ("how can we improve?") over static comparison ("who is #1?") (Brown et al., 2018; Daniels et al., 2020; Manyena et al., 2019; Gupta et al., 2010). They emphasize participatory evaluation cycles that inform real-time adjustments.
- **Benchmarking Tools**: Some indices still focus on cross-city/cross-sector comparison but are critiqued for oversimplification and lack of context sensitivity (Sharifi, 2016; Feldmeyer et al., 2019). Recent reviews recommend using composite scores only as entry points for deeper process-oriented assessment (Sharifi, 2016).

### 3.4 Cross-Cutting Themes

- Participatory approaches are essential for capturing context-specific dynamics and ensuring equity/inclusivity in resilience-building (Daniels et al., 2020; Tariq et al., 2021; Feldmeyer et al., 2019).
- Qualitative information is necessary alongside quantitative indicators to fully represent adaptive/transformative processes (Brown et al., 2018; Feldmeyer et al., 2019).
- There remain gaps in integrating temporal dynamism (tracking change over time) and multi-scalar relationships into most existing tools (Hoque et al., 2019; Sharifi, 2016).

## 4. Discussion

The shift toward process-based and governance-oriented frameworks marks a significant advance in measuring climate resilience at city/district/sectoral scales. These approaches better reflect the realities of complex systems facing uncertain futures by focusing on how decisions are made—not just what assets exist or outcomes are achieved (Manyena et al., 2019; Gupta et al., 2010). The Adaptive Capacity Wheel remains a gold standard for evaluating institutional readiness across multiple soft dimensions; DRIFT provides a rare operationalization of transformative capacity with clear links between theory and practice (Manyena et al., 2019; Gupta et al., 2010). However, challenges persist:

- Many tools still struggle with subjectivity in scoring soft attributes like inclusivity or flexibility; robust validation remains limited.
- There is a need for greater integration between quantitative monitoring systems and qualitative participatory processes.
- Most frameworks are designed as decision-support/M&E tools rather than ranking instruments—a positive trend—but this limits comparability across contexts unless harmonized core indicators are adopted.

Overall evidence strongly supports the use of mixed-methods process-based assessment as best practice for guiding local adaptation/transformation efforts under deep uncertainty.

## 5. Conclusion

Process-based and governance-oriented frameworks represent best practice for measuring climate resilience at sub-national/sectoral levels by focusing on adaptive/transformative capacities through participatory mixed-methods assessment rather than static asset counts or rankings. While significant progress has been made—especially with tools like the Adaptive Capacity Wheel and DRIFT—challenges remain around validation, integration of temporal/multi-scalar factors, and harmonization across contexts.

### Open Research Questions

Future research should focus on improving validation methods linking framework scores to real-world outcomes; integrating dynamic temporal/multi-scalar analysis into standard practice; harmonizing core indicators while retaining context sensitivity.

|Question|Why|
|---|---|
|**How can process-based framework scores be validated against observed post-disaster outcomes?**|Validation would increase confidence that these assessments predict real-world resilience performance.|
|**What methods best integrate temporal change tracking into local resilience assessments?**|Capturing changes over time is crucial to understanding whether interventions build lasting resilience.|
|**How can core indicators be harmonized globally while retaining local context sensitivity?**|Harmonization enables comparability without sacrificing relevance or equity across diverse settings.|

**Figure undefined:** Open questions highlight future directions in operationalizing climate resilience measurement.

In summary: Process-based assessment using participatory mixed methods offers the most robust approach currently available—but further work is needed on validation and dynamic analysis to fully realize its potential at city/district/sectoral scales.
