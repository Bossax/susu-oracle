# 1. Introduction

Recent advances in urban resilience research have moved beyond asset- or compliance-based metrics to frameworks that explicitly distinguish between **coping**, **adaptive**, and **transformative capacities** at the municipal level. These frameworks increasingly emphasize process-based indicators—such as organizational agility, learning cycles, and fiscal autonomy—that can be measured using secondary administrative data (e.g., budget files, procurement logs, project metadata) rather than surveys or qualitative assessments. Notably, several recent studies have operationalized these capacities through composite indices and multidimensional frameworks, mapping them to actionable qualities like flexibility, innovation, integration, and agency within local government systems (Lowe et al., 2024; Esposito, 2025; Turchi et al., 2023; Al-Humaiqani & Al‐Ghamdi, 2022; Zeng et al., 2022; Suárez et al., 2024; Rosengren et al., 2025). However, while coping and adaptive capacities are commonly measured with available administrative data (e.g., infrastructure stocks, budget reserves), transformative capacity—rooted in innovation and systemic change—remains less standardized but is increasingly addressed through process metrics such as plan revision frequency and cross-departmental collaboration (Lowe et al., 2024; Esposito, 2025; Suárez et al., 2024). This review synthesizes the latest literature on (1) frameworks distinguishing these capacities; (2) the feasibility of using administrative data as proxies for "soft" resilience attributes; and (3) how process-based scores have been translated into actionable recommendations for local governance.

## 2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus—including Semantic Scholar, PubMed, and other sources—using targeted queries on municipal resilience frameworks, process metrics for adaptation/innovation, and administrative data proxies for governance attributes. A total of 949 potentially relevant papers were identified; after de-duplication and screening for relevance to urban governance and climate adaptation (2018–2025), 588 papers were deemed eligible. The top 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

|Identification|Screening|Eligibility|Included|
|---|---|---|---|
|949|780|588|50|

**Figure 2:** Search strategy: filtering from initial identification to final inclusion. Twenty-one unique searches were executed across eight search groups targeting frameworks, process metrics mapping, administrative proxies, actionability/policy impact, adjacent fields (disaster management), critiques/limitations of process metrics, and citation graph expansion.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Framework Validation: Distinguishing Coping, Adaptive & Transformative Capacities

Multiple recent frameworks explicitly distinguish between coping (absorptive), adaptive, and transformative capacities at the municipal level:

- **Evolutionary Urban Resilience Frameworks**: Lowe et al. define urban resilience as encompassing recovery (coping), persistence/adaptive capacity (adjustment), and transformative capacity (systemic change), mapped to ten core qualities including flexibility, innovation, integration, inclusivity, and reflectivity (Lowe et al., 2024). These qualities are operationalized for local government planning.
- **Ladder/Scenario-Based Models**: Esposito proposes a "ladder of urban resilience," where baseline scenarios require coping capacity; critical scenarios demand adaptive responses; chronic crisis scenarios necessitate transformative capacity—each linked to specific processes such as learning feedback loops or distributed decision-making (Esposito, 2025).
- **Multi-Hazard Characterization**: Turchi et al. apply a methodology that identifies parameters for each capacity: e.g., financial assets for coping; planning instruments for adaptation; multi-stakeholder engagement for transformation (Turchi et al., 2023).
- **Composite Indices**: Suárez et al.'s Urban Resilience Index includes sub-indices for diversity/self-sufficiency (coping), polycentric governance/social cohesion (adaptive), learning/innovation/social-ecological justice (transformative) (Suárez et al., 2024).
- **Process Metrics Mapping**: Process-based qualities such as organizational agility ("flexibility"), double-loop learning ("reflectivity"), plan revision cycles ("innovation"), and cross-departmental collaboration ("integration") are directly mapped to transformative capacity in several frameworks (Lowe et al., 2024; Esposito, 2025; Suárez et al., 2024).

### 3.2 Data Feasibility: Administrative Proxies for Soft Resilience Attributes

Recent studies demonstrate the use of secondary administrative datasets as quantitative proxies:

#### Bureaucratic Friction

- **Procurement Time-Lags & Approval Bottlenecks**: Average procurement lead time or contract approval duration from municipal procurement logs serve as direct measures of bureaucratic friction (Al-Humaiqani & Al‐Ghamdi, 2022; Oza et al., 2025).
- **Red Tape Index**: Number of required approval steps or signatures per transaction extracted from workflow/process documentation (Al-Humaiqani & Al‐Ghamdi, 2022).

#### Agency/Autonomy

- **Fiscal Autonomy Indicators**:
    - Ratio of own-source revenue to total revenue from budget files (Masik & Gajewski, 2021).
    - Share of unrestricted vs. earmarked transfers in annual financial statements (Masik & Gajewski, 2021; Manyena et al., 2019).
    - Frequency/size of emergency spending authorized by mayoral decree without council approval.
- **Governance Structure**:
    - Degree of delegated authority coded from statutes or organizational charts.
    - In-year budget amendment frequency initiated by executive branch.

#### Innovation

- **Diversity of Budget Codes**: Number/diversity of functional budget codes used annually indicates flexibility/adaptiveness in resource allocation.
- **Plan Revision Frequency**: Number/frequency of formal updates to strategic plans or SOPs logged in official records (Lowe et al., 2024; Suárez et al., 2024).
- **After-action Review Compliance**: Proportion of major events with completed after-action reports within a set timeframe.

### 3.3 Actionability: Translating Process Scores into Governance Change

While many indices remain descriptive or diagnostic only a subset have demonstrably influenced local governance structures:

- **City of Melbourne Application**: The evolutionary framework was used by Melbourne to integrate resilience into policy/project evaluation—leading to new cross-sectoral working groups and iterative plan reviews rather than just infrastructure investments (Lowe et al., 2024).
- **Madrid Region Urban Resilience Index**: Application revealed gaps in social cohesion/learning dimensions; results informed targeted interventions such as new participatory budgeting processes and interdepartmental task forces (Suárez et al., 2024).
- **Resilience Measurement Tools Review**: Mehryar et al. found that only about one-third of tools support implementation/action planning; those that do often trigger changes like increased fiscal autonomy or new monitoring/reporting requirements rather than just asset upgrades (Mehryar et al., 2022).
- **Operationalization Challenges**: Some studies note that even when process scores highlight bottlenecks (e.g., slow procurement), translation into structural reform depends on political will—but there are documented cases where index results led to decentralization or streamlined procedures (Mehryar et al., 2022; Coaffee et al., 2018).

## 4. Discussion

The literature demonstrates strong theoretical consensus—and growing empirical validation—for distinguishing coping/absorptive, adaptive/incremental adjustment, and transformative/systemic change capacities at the municipal level using management science concepts (Lowe et al., 2024; Esposito, 2025; Turchi et al., 2023; Al-Humaiqani & Al‐Ghamdi, 2022; Zeng et al., 2022; Suárez et al., 2024). Recent frameworks operationalize these distinctions through measurable system qualities such as flexibility/agility (adaptive), innovation/learning cycles (transformative), redundancy/robustness (coping). Importantly, several studies show that these qualities can be proxied with secondary administrative data—such as procurement logs for friction/delay; budget files for fiscal autonomy; plan/SOP update records for innovation—enabling robust index construction without reliance on surveys.

However, challenges remain:

- Most indices still focus on coping/adaptive dimensions due to easier measurement via existing datasets; transformative capacity is less standardized but can be captured through process metrics like plan revision cycles or cross-departmental collaboration frequency.
- There is limited empirical evidence linking index results directly to major governance reforms—but documented cases exist where process-based findings led to increased fiscal autonomy or restructured decision-making bodies.
- Validation studies highlight the need for context-sensitive weighting/scaling methods when aggregating diverse indicators at the municipal level.

## 5. Conclusion

Management science approaches now underpin leading municipal climate resilience frameworks that distinguish coping/adaptive/transformative capacities—and these can be measured with secondary administrative data using well-chosen proxies for friction/delay (procurement logs), agency/autonomy (budget files), and innovation/process quality (plan/SOP updates). While actionability remains uneven across contexts—with some cities leveraging index results for real governance reform—the field is rapidly advancing toward robust quantitative measurement beyond compliance checklists.

### Research Gaps

Despite progress:

- Standardized indicators for transformative capacity are still rare.
- Many indices lack dynamic weighting/contextualization at the local scale.
- Empirical validation linking index scores directly to improved outcomes/governance reforms is limited.

#### Research Gaps Matrix

|Topic/Outcome|Coping Capacity Metrics|Adaptive Capacity Metrics|Transformative Capacity Metrics|Actionable Policy Change|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Procurement Delay|**7**|**2**|**GAP**|**2**|
|Fiscal Autonomy|**2**|**5**|**2**|**2**|
|Plan Revision Cycle|**GAP**|**2**|**4**|**1**|
|Cross-dept Collab|**GAP**|**2**|**4**|**2**|

**Figure 6:** Research gaps matrix showing coverage by metric type/capacity.

### Open Research Questions

Future work should focus on standardizing transformative/process indicators across contexts and empirically validating their linkages with real-world outcomes.

|Question|Why|
|---|---|
|**How can standardized administrative proxies best capture transformative capacity at the municipal level?**|To enable robust comparison across cities/countries while ensuring meaningful measurement of deep change processes.|
|**What weighting/scaling methods optimize comparability while respecting local context?**|Because indicator aggregation must balance comparability with sensitivity to unique city characteristics/policy needs.|
|**How do changes in process-based index scores translate into actual improvements in governance structures?**|To validate whether measurement leads not just to diagnosis but also effective reform/action at the local level.|

**Figure 7:** Open research questions guiding future work on municipal climate resilience indices.

In summary: Management science-informed approaches now allow municipalities to move beyond compliance toward performance-oriented climate resilience measurement using available administrative data—but further standardization and validation are needed before these tools can reliably drive systemic transformation at scale.
