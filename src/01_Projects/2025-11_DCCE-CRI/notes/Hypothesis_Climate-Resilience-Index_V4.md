# What could be done in this project that builds on CRI phase 1?

CRI phase 1 faces several limitations, especially damage and loss data. According to DDPM, they have developed PDNA (Post-Disaster Need Assessment) which includes damage estimate and loss survey. However, this standard has never been implemented by local officials. The damage and loss data is actually disaster relief compensation, not the actual damage and loss. Continuing CRI phase 2 will hit this bottleneck since. Without a step-up from DDPM, Thailand will continue facing the lack of disaster damage and loss information.

In addition, most census data has been collected with great effort in the spatial risk map development project. The datasets used in CRI overlap with the datasets used for the spatial risk map. However, ELT and data aggregation methods might vary. 

**The design philosophy of CRI is that it should be used alongside the spatial risk map. Thus, CRI should provide another perspective but complementary to the spatial risk map.** 

Since the approach of phase 1 CRI has hit the bottleneck, this approach should not be pursued heavily in phase 2. On the other hand, we will focus on enriching the CRI phase 1 result's context by bringing in external datasets to perform dasymetric mapping on the CRI values. The target of **the dasymetric mapping is to increase data granularity to municipality levels. We will devise simple but robust methods that are decision useful when using alongside the spatial risk map. No new fancy weighting schemes.** 

The result from CRI development based on phase 1 methodology will be served as adaptation effort benchmark for the provinces and municipalities. Municipalities with higher risk should  prioritize climate resilience building, where the effort can be reflected through the changes in the indicators of Climate Resilience Index

# CRI as Climate Resilience Index

based on track 2 of the project direction analysis, we will aggregate indicators that municipalities and Local Administrative Organizations are reporting via LPA and Sustainable City Platform. We will explore other data reporting platforms that might not be on our radar currently such as public health data reporting. Although the TOR says we need to build Data Entry Tool but this is against our design philosophy which tries to minimize reporting fatigue. 

We will develop bottom-up Climate Resilience Index at municipality level to help LAOs understand their resilience status. Using the enhanced climate risk index as a benchmark, we aim to inform if a municipality's resilience has fallen short as compared to the risk level.
