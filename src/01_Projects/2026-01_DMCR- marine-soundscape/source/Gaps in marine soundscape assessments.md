The research on marine soundscape assessments has identified several critical gaps and challenges that need to be addressed to enhance their utility for monitoring biodiversity and ecosystem health. These gaps span methodological, technological, geographical, and ecological dimensions.

# Methodological and Analytical Gaps:

1. **Discrimination of Sound Sources:** A primary challenge is the **lack of robust algorithms that can effectively discriminate among different sound sources** (geophysical, anthropogenic, and biological). Current ecoacoustic indexes (Eco-AIs), often developed for terrestrial environments, may be biased by environmental and anthropogenic noises, especially non-stationary ones, leading to mixed outcomes.

2. **Generalizability and Predictive Power of Acoustic Indices:**
    - There is **no reliable single metric that consistently predicts species richness across diverse ecosystems**. Features that correlate positively with biodiversity in one site can have an inverse relationship in another.
    - Machine learning models, while successful within datasets, **fail to generalize when applied to datasets they were not trained upon**, indicating that soundscapes with similar avian diversity do not necessarily share similar acoustic features.
    - The **reliability of acoustic indices is highly dependent on sufficient spatiotemporal replication** to capture both biological community variation and other influencing factors.

3. **Addressing Imperfect Detection and Masking:**
    - Current acoustic indices often **struggle to account for imperfect detection** of species, particularly for rare or uncommon ones, which can lead to a poor reflection of actual diversity patterns.
    - Loud, frequent, or omnipresent sounds (e.g., snapping shrimp, fish choruses, or anthropogenic noise) can **bias index results by masking lower-amplitude or less frequent biological signals**, making it difficult to discern true biodiversity.
    - **Soundscape change, while correlated with community change, still shows limitations** as similar soundscapes can be associated with very different avian communities.

4. **Validation and Baseline Data:**
    - A **scarcity or lack of historic baseline data** is a significant impediment to statistical comparisons with past records and building reference acoustic patterns.
    - The **validation of new Eco-AIs requires solid comparisons with biological sounds** and should be carried out on long-term datasets and a critical number of studies due to geographical and seasonal variations.
    - Acoustic indices often require **prior knowledge of sound origins and characteristics** for accurate interpretation.
    
5. **Limitations of Current Techniques:**
    - Long-term spectrogram analysis (LTSA) struggles to precisely display the **time-dependent spectral modulation of transient sounds**, requiring manual inspection for "rare" sounds.
    - Clustering algorithms can be biased when spectral representations are **corrupted by non-biological sources**.
    - Existing **vocalization detection algorithms mostly detect common species** due to reliance on vast amounts of training data.
    - The **Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) and acoustic entropy (H) may not reliably track call diversity** as they are sensitive to variations in sound abundance and intensity, and are affected by the overlap of biological and anthropogenic sounds.

# Technological and Data Management Gaps:

1. **Data Management and Analysis Capacity:** The massive amount of information generated by long-term and large-scale acoustic monitoring presents **difficulties in data management and analysis**, emphasizing the need for automated tools and sufficient computing capacity.
2. **Training Data for Machine Learning:** Deep learning and supervised Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) techniques require **prior knowledge of all sound sources of interest and sufficient training data**, which is often unavailable for most marine ecosystems and species.
3. **Lack of Open Databases and Tools:** A **comprehensive audio database of all soniferous marine organisms with metadata is still lacking**. While some open-source tools exist, there's a need for more diverse tools and open platforms that allow internet users to freely access and identify soundscape recordings.
4. **Standardization and Protocols:** The **lack of universally agreed-upon protocols** for extended soundscape studies hinders data sharing, reproduction, and integration. Guidelines and experience-based protocols for Eco-AI surveys are needed to ensure efficient measurement of biological sounds.

# Geographical and Ecological Gaps:

- **Understudied Marine Ecosystems:**
    - **Deep-sea habitats are commonly neglected**, with very few Eco-AIs tested below 1400m and only a handful of studies beyond 4000m. Knowledge of deep-sea fish and invertebrate sounds is scarce.
    - **Biodiversity hotspots in shallow tropical basins** (e.g., Mesoamerica, Melanesia Islands, Indo-Burma) also lack acoustic data.
    - **Vulnerable ecosystems such as seagrass meadows, kelp/algal forests, oyster reefs, mangroves, polar regions, and cold-water coral reefs are significantly underrepresented** in soundscape studies.
    - **Geographical bias**: Studies are heavily biased towards the Northern Hemisphere, with very low research effort in regions like the Arctic, Antarctica, Africa, South America (except Brazil), and the Middle East.
    
- **Temporal and Spatial Coverage:**
    - Most studies tend to be short-term, focusing on durations of months or days, with **fewer year-long studies**. Shorter recordings, particularly "snapshots," are likely to miss many transient acoustic behaviors and are not recommended for comprehensive assessments.
    - There is a clear need for **increased spatial replication and temporal coverage** to adequately capture the variability within and between habitats. Soundscapes can vary significantly even within meters in the same habitat.
    - The **detectability of species varies with environmental factors, propagation conditions, and timeframes** (diel, lunar, seasonal, annual cycles), requiring sufficient recording time to identify these cycles.

# Future Directions and Needs: To address these gaps, researchers emphasize the need for:

- **Developing new indexes specifically targeted to marine biological sounds** that account for their unique acoustic features and propagation characteristics.
- **Conducting pilot studies and collecting long-term, multi-year baseline datasets** across a wide array of environments, including underrepresented and human-impacted areas.
- **Integrating soundscapes with other biodiversity assessment methods**, such as eDNA, to provide a more comprehensive understanding.
- **Improving noise reduction techniques** to effectively separate biological sounds from ambient and anthropogenic noise.
- **Increasing spatial and temporal replication** in study designs to capture the full variability of marine soundscapes and biodiversity patterns.
- **Developing robust tools and concepts for data analysis**, leveraging big data and artificial intelligence for automatic classification and simulation of ocean soundscapes.
- **Establishing open data platforms and fostering collaboration** through initiatives like global field experiments to develop generalizable, reproducible, and comparable acoustic diversity methods.
- **Enhancing understanding of how acoustic features correlate with actual species richness** and community composition, accounting for factors like species-specific vocal repertoires and environmental context.

These identified gaps highlight that while passive acoustic monitoring is a promising non-invasive tool for studying marine biodiversity and ecosystem health, its full potential remains to be unlocked through dedicated research and methodological advancements.
