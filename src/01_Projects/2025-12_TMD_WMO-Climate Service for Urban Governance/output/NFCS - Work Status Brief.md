>[!note] Change Log
>15 Dec 2025: confirmation of work plan with TMD
>10 Feb 2026: Updated per 2026 Master Timeline. Confirmed workshop dates and "Governance" focus.

**1. Current project health & priority**
The project is **Green (On Track)** but entering a high-pressure phase. The **Consultation Workshop** is locked for **Mar 9-13**. Priority is now on **Stakeholder Mapping** (to ensure the right people are invited) and **Policy Review** (to frame the workshop discussion correctly).

**2. Near‑term focus (next 2–4 weeks)**

1.  **Stakeholder Mapping (Jan):** Finalize the invitee list with strict "Technical Qualification" criteria to avoid tokenism.
2.  **Mandate Review (Jan):** Analyze the Climate Change Act and TMD Master Plan to define the legal boundary for climate services.
3.  **KII Preparation (Feb):** Launch Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) and the Baseline Survey to gather data *before* the workshop.
4.  **Workshop Logistics:** Confirm venue and send invitations for the Mar 9-13 event.
5.  **Task Force Strategy:** Initiate discussions with the Urban Act team to piggback on their Task Force structure.

**3. Key decisions & assumptions to remember**

-   **Workshop is Fixed:** March 9-13 is the hard deadline. Baseline data must be ready to present.
-   **Governance over Tech:** This project is about *Institutional Mandates*, not building software.
-   **Urban Act Synergy:** We assume we can leverage the Urban Act Task Force. If that fails, we need a backup plan for governance.
-   **"Capacity" not "Infrastructure":** We frame climate services as "Technical Capacity Development" to fit budget rules.

**4. Imminent milestones & deadlines**

-   **Jan 2026:** Progress Meeting #1 (Stakeholder Map & KII Plan).
-   **Feb 2026:** Launch of Baseline Survey.
-   **Early Mar 2026:** Draft Baseline Assessment Report (Internal).
-   **9–13 Mar 2026:** Consultation Workshop #1 (Critical Milestone).

**5. Short‑term risks & watchpoints**

-   **Wrong People:** If agencies send junior staff to the workshop, we can't make policy decisions.
-   **Survey Silence:** Risk of low response rate to the baseline survey. Need a "Chaser" strategy.
-   **Mandate Conflict:** Potential resistance from agencies (DDPM/DPT) if they feel TMD is encroaching on their territory.

**6. Next sponsor/steering message**

-   **Workshop Locked:** We are full steam ahead for the **Mar 9-13 Consultation Workshop**.
-   **Mandate Review:** We are currently analyzing the legal landscape (Climate Change Act) to ensure our proposal is legally sound.
-   **Stakeholder Quality:** We are setting strict criteria for workshop attendees to ensure a high-level technical discussion.
-   **Synergy:** We are actively coordinating with the Urban Act team to avoid duplicating governance structures.
