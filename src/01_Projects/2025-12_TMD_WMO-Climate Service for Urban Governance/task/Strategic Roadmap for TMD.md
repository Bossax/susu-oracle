# Strategic Implications for the Roadmap
[[NFCS - Institutional Knowledge & Risk Log]]

Based on the above, the **NFCS Roadmap** must effectively function as a **"Change Management Plan"** for TMD. It cannot simply be a technical list of new weather stations. It must:

1. **Justify the Budget:** Provide the "financial narrative" TMD needs to secure funding.
2. **Bridge the Gap:** Focus heavily on the "User Interface Platform" (UIP)—the translation layer—rather than just observation hardware.
3. **Institutionalize Roles:** Move climate services from a "Division Task" to a "Department Mandate" by embedding responsibilities in job descriptions, not just project teams.
