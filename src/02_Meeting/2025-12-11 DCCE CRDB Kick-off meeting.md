# Objective
1. confirm project scopes and interpretation
2. confirm timeline of the project
3. confirm collaboration with other projects, especially UNDP BTR 'climate risk data'


# Deliverable dates
1. 7 January 2026: inception report
2. 7 April 2026: 2nd submission (could be shifted 1 week earlier)
3. 6 July 2026: 3rd submission
4. 4 September 2026: final report (could be shifted 2 weeks earlier)

** the shift in submission time is due to governmental accounting system reasons

# Outlook of DCCE's projects
They are aiming to request a budget to implement a data system infrastructure for climate change adaptation information platform next year. So, the outputs of this project will be used for the infrastructure construction.

# Scope of work
## TOR 5.2
- 3 focus group discussions : these meetings require department-wide participants. This including staff from the climate change adaptation division, IT division, and and other relevant divisions. The focus group meetings are for getting feedback on the National Climate Adaptation Information Platform and data architectures.
- Right now, the Climate Change Center website is overseen by the greenhouse gas reduction division. They want to transfer the control of website content to the climate change adaptation division.
- NCAIF: Toey mentioned these key words; 'data flow', 'data management', 'who will develop what content', ' what should be present on the website and how'
## TOR 5.3 
 - Baseline data inventory: start from [[Evergreens/Spatial climate risk map DCCE v2|Spatial climate risk map DCCE v2]]. expand beyond these datasets. The topic would be risk assessment. Toey mentioned 'data dictionaries', and ''use for BTR reporting". The reporting is like "climatic and weather conditions"
 - Interviewing stakeholders for use cases. Focus on how could DCCE and boundary organizations could collaborate in the future to develop analytics products.
 - Toey mentioned that the stakeholders may not be able to come up with use cases on spot. Prepare examples for discussion is recommended

# Workshop
- the public hearing and the brainstorming workshop could be held on the same day with slightly different groups of stakeholders
- Merging ADPC's consultation workshop [[2025-12-11 UNDP BTR]] with the brainstorming workshop might not be 100 doable since ADPC's workshop focuses on the potential data owners to can supply their data to the platform while this workshop is broader, including impacts, hazards, exposure, vulnerability, adaptation and use cases


# Proposal

I presented the project framing concept, making this project's output like system requirements for implementing the IT infrastructure in the second phase and the DCCE agreses
