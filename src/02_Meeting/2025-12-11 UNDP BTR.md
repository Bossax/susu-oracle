# UNDP BTR
 - went over the dataset list prepared by ADPC 
 - Toey (the director of 'risk assessment' subdivision under the 'Climate Change Adaptation' division under the Department of Climate Change and Environment (DCCE)) comments that the exposure datasets shall be minimal.

DDPM has collected event occurrence data at village level ( the smallest administrative unit, smaller than sub-district (Tambon)). There are 3 hazards; flood,drought, and tropical cyclone that are recorded. They pair the event occurrence frequency with 'impact' data to come up with 'risk levels'. The impact data is represented by impacted assets such as cropland, roads, bridges, schools, temples, hospitals, actories. The methodology of assessing impact or surveying the asset data is unknown. 

Flood events are also defined by types of floods including 'riverine', 'pluvial', 'flash flood'

drought event record run back 6 years only. 

risk assessment is not updated frequently. It is part of their one time project which risks data continuity.

Heat index
- Department of Health (กรมอนามัย) and Thai Meteorological Department (TMD) have developed heat index products

## ADPC consultation workshop
it is planned to take place on **11 February 2026**. The target number of participants is 30 people. The stakeholders are data owners who could supply continuous high-quality data to the risk platform. Toey also wants to use this opportunity to narrow down the set of essential exposure datasets. He is concerned about having too many exposure layers but not used by data users. The selection of what is included is arbitrary at this point. So, more inputs from the real data users are needed, which could be obtained through the DCCE_CRDB project?
