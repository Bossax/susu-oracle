# CRI
## CRI pilot summary
- time frames
	- short time frame = 1 year
	- long time frame = 8 years
- Data availability
	- The required data of only 22 provinces can be downloaded from government open data sources
	- 2023 has disaggregated damage data of agricultural and non-agricultural sectors
- Recommendations from stakeholders
	- include non-economic loss <!--comment: No-->
	- UNDRR/MCR2030 balanced scorecard
	- include vulnerable groups into the design of the index
	- disaggregate data to sectors

<!--comment:  The recommendations are divergent and target the core design principles of the index. I assume the team did not state clearly at the beginning the objective and use case of this index-->

# BTR
## Baseline framework 
### National level
Climate baseline
- 30 year average moving average

**Result chain**
1. Risk, Impact, and vulnerability baselines
	- 5-10 years
2. Monitor risk and vulnerability profile
3. <!--note: Plan adaptation actions-->
4. Implement the planed actions
5. Monitor outcome
6. Evaluate impact

### Sub-national / project level
Climate baseline
- pre-project
**Result chain**
1. Climate risk baseline
	- Project specific risk and vulnerability assessment
2. Adaptation project baseline
	- pre-intervention
3. Monitoring output
4. Evaluate output attribution/contribution to national level outcome


- P Tik is framing the information required in the baseline framework with A-BTR structure. 

- Map NAP action plan and CU team's indicators to GGA indicators 

- Indicators can be grouped
	- measurable or applicable to setting targets
	- qualitative indicators meant to gauge overall context, not setting targets
