# Key acoustic parameters
Sound Pressure Level (SPL) and Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) are widely used acoustic indices in marine ecoacoustics to assess and discriminate among different ecological states of coral reefs.

- **General Application**: Both SPL and ACI provide information about soundscapes and can classify different ecological states within marine environments. The study specifically focused on these two indices because they are the most widely used on coral reefs.
- **Discriminating Ecostates based on Frequency Bands**:
    - **Healthy Reef Environments**: High values of **SPL (or Power Spectral Density [PSD]) or ACI in the lower frequencies (< 1 kHz)** typically indicate healthy reef environments. These healthy environments are characterized by diverse and abundant reef fish assemblages, high coral cover and richness, high crustose coralline algae cover, high structural complexity, or a high density of mobile macro-invertebrates. Sounds in frequencies below 1 kHz are primarily dominated by fish sounds.
    - **Degraded Ecostates**: Conversely, **elevated levels of SPL or ACI in the higher frequencies (> 2 kHz)** usually point to more degraded ecostates, such as areas with dead corals and abundant macroalgae. This is because degraded habitats often have a higher proportion of invertebrates like snapping shrimps, which are dominant producers of high-frequency sounds. Macroalgae also contribute to high-frequency sounds through the "ping" created when oxygen gas bubbles, a product of photosynthesis, detach from their surface.

- **Complementary Information**: Relying on a single index or frequency band is often insufficient. The simultaneous use of different ecoacoustic indices calculated on several frequency bands provides a more comprehensive understanding of the soundscape.
    - SPL and ACI offer **complementary information**; for instance, in the same frequency band (e.g., 2–7 kHz), SPL and ACI can yield distinct rankings of ecostates, highlighting different aspects of the soundscape.
    - Similarly, lower frequency (< 1 kHz) combinations and higher frequency (> 2 kHz) combinations are only loosely correlated, while both are moderately correlated to medium frequency (1–2 kHz) combinations. Using both low and high-frequency bands is essential for successful differentiation among some ecostates.

- **Optimized Sampling Scheme**: The study developed an optimized passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) sampling scheme that uses a **group of five specific combinations** of SPL and ACI with particular settings to reliably detect differences in coral reef ecostates. These optimized combinations include:
    - **SPL night 0.1–0.5 kHz, 5 min samples** (requiring 250 min of sampling effort).
    - **SPL night 1–2 kHz, 5 s samples** (requiring 92 min of sampling effort).
    - **SPL night 2–7 kHz, 5 s samples** (requiring 14 min of sampling effort).
    - **ACI night 0.5–1 kHz, 5 min samples** (requiring 200 min of sampling effort).
    - **ACI night 2–7 kHz, 5 s samples** (requiring 20 min of sampling effort).
- **Nighttime Sampling**: All five selected optimal combinations rely on **acoustic data sampled at night** because nocturnal combinations generally show greater discriminating power, require less sampling effort, and are more stable across moon phases compared to daytime combinations.
- **Validation**: The classifications of ecological states obtained using this optimized acoustic sampling scheme have been shown to be **congruent with visual ecological surveys**. This confirms the potential of ecoacoustics to rapidly and reliably characterize coral reefs' ecostate.

# Optimized passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) sampling scheme
The study proposes and validates an **optimized passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) sampling scheme** designed to reliably detect differences in the ecological states (ecostates) of coral reefs. This scheme is intended for wide application in prioritizing conservation areas and detecting the onset of ecological disturbances.

Here's a detailed discussion of the optimized sampling scheme:

**1. Purpose and Development:** The scheme was developed because, while PAM is a promising tool for marine ecological monitoring, the specific methods for its application were poorly defined. The researchers aimed to provide **clear guidelines for monitoring soundscapes** using the most widely adopted ecoacoustic indices in the marine realm.

- **Iterative Approach**: The development involved an iterative approach to select the most efficient and consistent combinations of sampling settings. This included examining how different combinations of frequency bandwidth, time of sampling (day/night), and sample duration influenced the ability of Sound Pressure Level (SPL) and Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) to discriminate among ecostates.
- **Temporal Stability and Sampling Effort**: The selection criteria focused on combinations that showed **stability in their discriminating power** across different time scales (successive days, moon phases, and seasons) and required the **minimum sampling effort** for reliable ecostate assessment.
- **Focus on SPL and ACI**: The study specifically focused on SPL and ACI because they are the two acoustic indices most widely used on coral reefs. SPL (or Power Spectral Density) describes physical properties like amplitude, while ACI provides additional information about soundscapes.

**2. Components of the Optimized Sampling Scheme:** The optimized scheme consists of a **group of five specific combinations** of SPL and ACI, all relying on **nighttime acoustic data**. These combinations were selected to maximize the representativeness of various aspects of the soundscape by including different types of indices and bandwidths.

The five optimal combinations are:

- **SPL night 0.1–0.5 kHz, 5 min samples**: Requires a minimum sampling effort of **250 minutes**.
- **SPL night 1–2 kHz, 5 s samples**: Requires a minimum sampling effort of **92 minutes**.
- **SPL night 2–7 kHz, 5 s samples**: Requires a minimum sampling effort of **14 minutes**.
- **ACI night 0.5–1 kHz, 5 min samples**: Requires a minimum sampling effort of **200 minutes**.
- **ACI night 2–7 kHz, 5 s samples**: Requires a minimum sampling effort of **20 minutes**.

**3. Key Characteristics and Insights from its Development:**

- **Nighttime Sampling**: All five optimal combinations involve **nighttime recordings**. Nocturnal combinations generally exhibited **greater discriminating power**, required **less sampling effort**, and were **more stable across moon phases** compared to daytime combinations. While dusk and dawn choruses are important acoustically, the rapid changes during these periods introduce too much variability, making them less suitable for a robust comparative sampling scheme. Nighttime sampling may also be less impacted by anthropogenic effects like recreational boating.
- **Frequency Band Interpretation**:
    - **High values of SPL or ACI in lower frequencies (< 1 kHz)** are associated with **healthy reef environments**. These areas are characterized by diverse and abundant reef fish assemblages, high coral cover, high structural complexity, or dense mobile macro-invertebrates. Fish sounds primarily dominate these lower frequencies.
    - **Elevated levels of SPL or ACI in higher frequencies (> 2 kHz)** typically indicate **more degraded ecostates**, such as areas with dead corals and abundant macroalgae. This is attributed to a higher proportion of invertebrates like snapping shrimps, which are dominant producers of high-frequency sounds, and the "ping" sounds from oxygen bubbles detaching from macroalgae during photosynthesis.
- **Sample Duration for Different Frequencies**:
    - **Very short recording times (e.g., 5-second samples)** are sufficient for indices calculated in the **higher frequency band (> 2 kHz)**. This is because high-frequency sounds, like snapping shrimp snaps, are very frequent and short-lasting (approx. 2 ms), so even a 5-second sample can capture numerous events.
    - **Longer recording times (e.g., 5-minute samples)** are necessary when using indices calculated in the **lower frequency bands (< 1 kHz)**. Fish sounds, which dominate these frequencies, are less frequent and can last from 100 ms to a few seconds, requiring longer samples to reliably reflect fish activity and differentiate assemblages.
- **Complementary Information**: The study highlights that **acoustic monitoring should not rely on a single index or frequency band**, but rather on the simultaneous use of different ecoacoustic indices calculated across several frequency bands. SPL and ACI provide **complementary information**; they can yield distinct rankings of ecostates in the same frequency band, and using both low and high-frequency bands is essential for successful differentiation among some ecostates.
- **Seasonal Variation**: While the ranking of ecostates remained stable within each season, **strong seasonal variation prevented across-season comparisons**. This suggests that comparisons among ecostates should rely on data collected within a single period of the year.

**4. Validation and Applicability:** The optimized sampling scheme was initially developed at Reunion Island (Indian Ocean) and subsequently **tested and validated at New Caledonia (Pacific Ocean)**.

- **Congruence with Visual Surveys**: The classifications of ecostates obtained using the optimized acoustic sampling scheme were **congruent with those obtained through visual ecological surveys**. This confirms the potential of ecoacoustics to rapidly and reliably characterize coral reefs' ecostate.
- **Subtle Differences**: Interestingly, the acoustic classification showed potential for **detecting more subtle ecostate differences** than visual data.
- **Wide Applicability**: The successful application of the scheme across geographically distant sites (Reunion Island and New Caledonia), despite marked differences in their soundscapes, suggests its **wide applicability** and capacity to detect ecological differences among sites with different species assemblages.
- **Practical Use**: This methodology offers a rapid and reliable tool that can **facilitate the prioritization of conservation targets** and aid in the **detection of disturbances** (i.e., changes in ecostates), potentially allowing remote sampling at wider spatial scales.

**5. Limitations and Future Considerations:** The time-consuming step of data screening and cleaning remains a major limitation for widespread PAM implementation, especially for indices like SPL/PSD that are strongly affected by geophony and anthrophony below 2 kHz. However, ongoing advancements in automated sound detection and classification are expected to provide effective tools for cleaning ambient sound samples soon.
