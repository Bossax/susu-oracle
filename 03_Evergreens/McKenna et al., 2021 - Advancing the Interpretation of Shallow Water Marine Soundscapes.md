# Acoustic Variables and Parameters

The core of the study revolves around the characterization of soundscapes through various acoustic measurements:

## Sound Pressure Level
1. **Octave Band Sound Pressure Levels (OLs)**: Derived by integrating PSD levels over each octave band, with nominal center frequencies ranging from 125 to 20,000 Hz.
2. **Broadband Sound Pressure Levels (BBLs)**: Integrated over the full frequency range of 88 to 22,387 Hz (IEC bands 20-43).

**Frequency Content**: The distribution of sound energy across different frequencies, often visualized through spectrograms and analyzed in specific octave bands.
1. **Power Spectral Density (PSD) Levels**: Calculated per hour with a resolution of 1 Hz/1 second from 20 Hz to 24,000 Hz, converted to decibels (dB re 1 µPa²/Hz).


**Temporal Patterns**: Recurring features in sound levels related to time of day, presence within a given period, or short transient signals versus continuous presence. This includes variations over seconds, minutes, hours, days, seasonally, latitudinally, and with celestial factors.



# Contextual Knowledge (Non-Acoustic Variables for Interpretation)
The study emphasizes integrating contextual knowledge from biological, environmental, and human use data to interpret sound level measurements effectively. These include:

- **Source Identification (Acoustic and Non-Acoustic)**:
    - **Biological Sources (Biotic)**:
        - Presence and activity of specific marine mammal species (e.g., humpback whales, blue, fin, sei, North Atlantic right whales).
        - Presence and activity of specific fish species (e.g., plainfin midshipman, Atlantic cod, other fish choruses).
        - Activity of other biological sources like snapping shrimp.
    - **Human Activity (Anthropogenic)**:
        - **Vessel Presence/Shipping Traffic**: Monitored using Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders within a 10 km buffer around a site, including ship operational hours and counts of unique vessels.
        - Proximity to commercial ports, shipping lanes, fishing grounds, and resource extraction sites.
    - **Abiotic Conditions**:
        - **Wind Speed**: Hourly averages calculated from nearby NOAA buoys.
        - **Tidal Flow**: Measured as the change in height above sea level from the previous hour.
        - Rain noise (mentioned as a chronic sound source).
## Site Features

Site features are crucial for understanding Sound Pressure Levels (SPLs) in the study because **characterizing soundscapes through sound levels alone leads to incomplete descriptions and can impede meaningful comparisons**. Site features provide the necessary **contextual knowledge** to interpret what is driving the observed sound levels.

Here's how site features are used to enhance the understanding of SPLs:

- **Disambiguating Sound Sources and Conditions:**
    - Sound levels can be similar at different sites even if the underlying sound sources (biological, anthropogenic, or abiotic) are very different. Site features help **reveal which sources are driving observed SPL differences or similarities**. For instance, combining SPL measurements with an understanding of environmental and human-use context and source identification clarifies the drivers.
    - The study emphasizes that **integrating contextual knowledge, such as source identification and site information, is vital for soundscape interpretation**.
    
- **Understanding the Influence of Physical Conditions on SPLs:**
    - **Tidal Flow:** At sites with significant tidal changes, **sound levels can correlate with the magnitude of tidal flow**. This can introduce "artificial sound" from water flowing around the sensor or cable strumming, inflating low-frequency SPLs and making them resemble levels from high shipping traffic. By understanding the tidal regime as a site feature, researchers can **identify and remove periods with minimal tidal flow to obtain more accurate and comparable sound level metrics** that reflect the actual environmental sound.
    - **Wind Speed:** Wind at the ocean surface predictably increases underwater sound levels. However, this relationship can be complicated in shallow waters by sound propagation conditions, distant vessel noise, and biological choruses. By monitoring wind speed (e.g., from a nearby NOAA buoy), researchers can **identify when sound levels deviate from the expected relationship with wind, indicating the presence of other dominant sources** (e.g., a fish chorus).
    - **Bathymetry and Bottom Type:** These geospatial features **determine the propagation of sounds** and, along with receiver characteristics, influence the distances at which sources are detected. This means that even nearby sites can have different soundscapes due to variations in propagation conditions. The study illustrated this with two Olympic Coast NMS sites, where a shallower site's SPLs correlated with tidal changes in lower frequencies, while a deeper site correlated with shipping activity.

- **Assessing Anthropogenic and Biological Contributions:**
    - **Proximity to Human Activity:** Site features such as **distance to commercial ports, designated shipping lanes, fishing grounds, or resource extraction sites** profoundly influence the characteristics of sounds present in a soundscape.
        - High human use areas will show sound levels that "reflect the anthropogenic influences on the soundscape".
        - In coastal regions near major ports, **ship noise often becomes the dominant feature, elevating low-frequency SPLs and masking biological activity**. Knowledge of vessel traffic (e.g., from AIS data) allows researchers to interpret these high sound levels as being driven by shipping rather than other sources.
        - Conversely, sites with relatively low human activity but high sound levels might reveal dominant biological features. **Separating sites based on the level of nearby human activity provides crucial context for interpreting SPLs**.
    - **Proximity to Biological Hotspots:** Site features like **spawning grounds or migration corridors** dictate the presence and intensity of biological sounds, which can significantly contribute to SPLs. The study highlights examples where biological choruses can create high sound levels, sometimes mimicking wind noise or even dominating the soundscape over human activity.
    
- **Informing Spatial and Temporal Sampling:**
    - Site features guide the design of monitoring networks, as **spatial proximity alone is not enough to indicate similar sound levels**. Factors like human use patterns, sound propagation conditions, and management area types should inform spatial sampling.
    - **Temporal patterns** in sound levels, related to daily, seasonal, or celestial factors, are also informed by prior knowledge of sources present and site features.




# Challenges with acoustic indices
The study notes that while acoustic indices exist, they have had "mixed results" in marine environments. A key issue is that variation in sound levels measured by these indices can be driven by different features and "in some cases the indices do not distinguish between these features". This suggests that while indices offer mathematical summaries, they might not always provide the clear, source-separated insights that an integrated SPL approach aims to achieve.
