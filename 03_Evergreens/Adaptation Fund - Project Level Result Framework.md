# Project Design
## Project Design Logical Framework Matrix
#LogicalFrameworkApproach 

Logical Framework Approach is suggested to be done during the design process. This one aligns with OECD recommendations.  
  
Logframe includes  
1. Root cause analysis
2. Theory of Change
3. Project Risks
4. Activities lead to outputs that form outcomes which leave impacts behind


>[!warning] beaurocracy of logframe
>logframe is not mere paperwork, but an output of collaboration among stakehodlers. don't fall into this putfall.

## Checklist for selecting good indicators
General list is obtained through brainstorming before selecting those that best match these criteria
Multi-Criteria Assessment Matric = MCAM 

| Criteria/attributes               | Consider                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Validity                          | Does the indicator measure the result?                                                       |
| Precise meaning                   | Do stakeholders agree on exactly what the indicator measures?                                |
| Practical, affordable, and simple | Are data actually available at reasonable cost and effort? Will it be easy to collect and analyze the information? |
| Reliability                       | Is it a consistent measure over time?                                                        |
| Sensitivity                       | When the result changes will it be susceptible to those changes?                             |
| Clear direction                   | Are we sure whether an increase is good or bad?                                              |
| Utility                           | Will the information be useful for decision-making, accountability, and learning?            |
| Owned                             | Do stakeholders agree that this indicator makes sense to use?                                |


## Data collection and summary matrix
Good practices entail the development of performance monitoring plans at the beginning of the project that explain 
1. how
2. when
3. who will collect data

a matrix framework tool to record summary information about monitoring plans

| EXPECTED RESULTS   | INDICATORS | BASELINE DATA | TARGETS | DATA SOURCES | DATA COLLECTION METHODS | FREQUENCY | RESPONSIBILITY |

| Activities:        |            |               |         |              |                         |           |                |
**Activities Data**: Used for analysis of **performance issues** such as economy and efficiency.
- Data Source: Typically comes from project financial accounts and management reports from field sites.
- Data Collection Methods: A good financial accounting system is needed to keep track of expenditures and provide cost data. The higher the level in the log frame hierarchy the tendency for data collection efforts to become more expensive and data sources more difficult to find.
- Frequency: Used primarily for day-to-day operations and short-term decisions
- Responsibility: **Project staff** with frequent inspection to assess fulfillment of work plans and budget. Place data collection responsibility closer to those using the data.

**Outputs Data**: Used for **short-to-medium term management** decisions designed at improving output quality, equitable distribution to beneficiaries, productivity, and efficiency, etc.
- Data Source: Tends to originate from project field reports maintained by project staff 
- Data Collection Methods: 
- Frequency: The data are combined and reported to higher project management levels at regular periods (for example, bi-annually or annually). 
- Responsibility: **Project field staff**.

**Outcome Data**: Useful for **medium-term management** decisions aimed at improving beneficiary satisfaction or changes in behavior and to evaluate effectiveness in achieving intermediate results.
- Data source: follow-up surveys with project beneficiaries
- Data Collection Methods: These tend to be affordable surveys, which assemble information on beneficiaries’ responses to and satisfaction with project outputs as well as changes in their knowledge and behaviors. These methods include informal consultations or mini surveys, market research, rapid appraisal or participatory methods. Data should be divided by beneficiaries’ socio-economic characteristics to assist later analysis of equitable distribution of benefits, etc. These methods do involve data collection and social science research skills or training beyond regular record keeping and thus should be planned and budgeted for in project design.
- Frequency: Annually or when feedback is needed.
- Responsibility: **Project staff**

**Impact data**: is not covered in this guidance document since the responsibility tends to fall outside project managers. Recording data up to the secondary outcome level, which falls within project mangers responsibility, should give solid insight and linkages towards impacts. check [[Monitoring and Evaluation for Adaptation - Lessons from Development Co-operation Agencies]]


Selecting data collection methods and **sources***

| Criteria/attributes              | Consider                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Validity:                        | Do the data mean what we think they mean? Do the measurement techniques indeed measure what they declare to measure?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Reliability:                     | Is it a consistent measure over time? Is the measure, after applied repeatedly to a given situation, consistently yields the same results if the circumstances remained unchanged between applications?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Timeliness:                      | Can the data be collected routinely enough and is up to date to inform management’s decision-making processes? Some methods can be more quickly implemented and therefore better when needed at recurrent intervals or immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Costs:                           | Is there any budget constraint that would need to be considered before selecting methods? Some complex surveys are expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Formal versus informal methods:  | Informal methods include casual conversations or unstructured site visits, which tend to be inexpensive and quick to implement, sometimes compromising credibility. Formal methods comprise censuses and sample surveys, which have high reliability and validity, but higher cost (including extensive technical skills) and are time-consuming. In-between, one can find rapid appraisal methods like focus groups, community interviews, key informant interviews, direct observation, etc. |
