> [!annotation] History
> - The APF is widely regarded as one of the first comprehensive guidance frameworks to systematize the adaptation policy cycle, providing a clear, iterative process for assessing vulnerability, planning, implementing, and monitoring adaptation to climate change\
> - The APF drew upon earlier work such as the 1994 IPCC Technical Guidelines for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Adaptations, but introduced crucial innovations—grounding adaptation in present climate variability, stressing stakeholder participation, and integrating adaptation into development contexts
> - Before the APF, adaptation guidance was largely fragmented or embedded within broader assessments. The APF established a focused process that addressed adaptation as a policy cycle and directly influenced later instruments, including the frameworks and guidelines developed under the UNFCCC's subsequent programs (like the Cancun Adaptation Framework of 2010 and the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Technical Guidelines\

#  Structure of the Guidebook
[[APF - Guidebook]]
1. The Guidebook begins with an **overview of the APF**, including the relationship between its seven Components and nine TPs, various options for using the APF, and key adaptation concepts.

2. It then **dedicates a section to each of the APF Components**, detailing key concepts, tasks, and challenges involved in carrying out these activities.

3. To help users understand the main themes of each Component, its purpose, process, and desired outputs are indicated at the beginning of each section.

4. Each Component section concludes with "Key Issues" and a "Checklist" to highlight major issues, decisions, and interim products.

# Technical Papers presented

- [[APF - TP1 Scoping and Designing an Adaptation Project]]
- **Technical Paper 2: Engaging Stakeholders in the Adaptation Process**
- [[APF - TP3 Assessing Vulnerability for Climate Adaptation]]
- [[APF - TP4 Assessing Current Climate Risks]]
- **Technical Paper 5: Assessing Future Climate Risks**
- [[APF - TP6 Assessing Current and Changing Socio-economic Conditions]]
- [[APF - TP7 Assessing and Enhancing Adaptive Capacity]]
- **Technical Paper 8: Formulating an Adaptation Strategy**
- [[APF - TP9 Continuing the Adaptation Process]]
-

These Technical Papers are presented for several key reasons:

- **Addressing a Lack of Practical Guidance**: The TPs, along with the Guidebook, were developed to **address a critical gap in practical guidance on climate change adaptation**. While much literature exists on climate change impacts, information on adaptation policy and strategies was limited.
- **Providing Detailed, User-Friendly Guidance**: Their primary objective is to **offer concise, user-friendly, and accessible guidance** on appropriate adaptation approaches and tools, tailored to a country's unique national circumstances. They provide **detailed guidance** on specific aspects or Components of the APF.
- **Serving as Technical Resources**: The TPs provide the **technical resources** needed to effectively guide adaptation inquiries and lead to the most effective solutions across various decision-making levels, from local to national. They expand the existing body of guidance for adaptation assessment, planning, and implementation.


- **Flexibility in Use**: Not all APF users will need to use all TPs. The decision of which TPs to rely on most heavily **depends almost entirely on the goals of the adaptation project, the information and resources available at the outset, and the specific project approach selected** (e.g., vulnerability-based, hazards-based, policy-based, or adaptive-capacity). However, all adaptation projects using the APF are encouraged to draw upon TP1 (Scoping and Designing), TP2 (Stakeholder Engagement), TP7 (Adaptive Capacity), TP8 (Formulating Strategy), and TP9 (Continuing Process) for customized design and successful implementation.
-
- **Practical Application**: The TPs focus on **practice rather than theory**, building on existing information countries already possess about vulnerable systems like agriculture or water resources. They offer progressive, step-by-step guidance, tools, examples, and tips for implementing adaptation activities.

# Principles of the APF

- **Adaptation to short-term climate variability and extreme events serves as a starting point for reducing vulnerability to longer-term climate change**. This principle helps users firmly ==ground their decisions in the priorities of the present== as they prepare for near-, medium-, and longer-term adaptation. A key innovation of the APF is that it works from current climate variability and extremes, assessing recent climate experiences, thereby linking the near-term to the medium- and longer-terms. #DRR #Adaptation_principle 

- **Adaptation occurs at different levels in society, including the local level**. The APF combines national policy-making with a proactive "bottom-up" risk management approach, enabling users to focus on and respond to key adaptation priorities at both national and ==village scales==. This strong emphasis on local-level adaptation includes involving stakeholders and public participation at the community level. #Locally_led_adaptation #Mutilevel_governance

- **Adaptation policy and measures should be assessed in a development context**. This means that the APF supports adaptation processes to protect and enhance human well-being in the face of climate change. By making policy the centerpiece of adaptation, the APF shifts the focus from individual adaptation projects towards a fundamental ==integration of adaptation into key policy and planning processes==. The APF is designed to help countries integrate adaptation concerns into the broader goals of national development, ultimately leading to harmonization of adaptation with a country's often more pressing development priorities like poverty alleviation, food security enhancement, and disaster management. #Mutilevel_governance #Development_plan 

- **The adaptation strategy and the stakeholder process by which it is implemented are equally important**. The APF places a strong emphasis on the **broad engagement of stakeholders**, viewing them as instrumental in driving each stage of the adaptation process. This is a distinguishing feature of the APF, which is described as a "stakeholder-driven approach".

At its heart, the APF is about practice rather than theory. It starts with information that developing countries already possess concerning vulnerable systems like agriculture, water resources, public health, and disaster management. The APF recognizes the value of building on existing knowledge, utilizing synergies and intersecting themes to enable more informed and effective policy-making and to guide adaptation. The APF also emphasizes flexibility, encouraging users to employ only the analytical techniques that meet their unique needs.
