# Methodology

employ thematic analysis on meeting transcripts; document coding. Engagement ran over 2 years with experts from various fields. The experts are at the manager levels.

# Typology of actionable climate information

## Type and sub-type

![typology of information use 0.png](typology%20of%20information%20use%200.png)

### 1. Detailed data and results

1. Changes in decision-relevant metrics: average, peak, ebb, variability, threshold, tails of distribution, probability distribution
2. Decision-relevant events: max flood event, max wind speed, to inform design parameters
3. Driver and process: key regional climatic process →  atmospheric oscillation, atmospheric rivers, THCs, antecendent conditions

### 2. Broad trends and patterns

how climate change might broadly impact regional hydro-climatological processes

e.g. is the wet season drier or wetter

### 3. Data improvement and guidance

managers had access to some data, but sought improvements in data scale and quality, or wanted guidance on how to appropriately use the information in decision-contexts

1. Available data needs improvements or refinements both in terms of their accuracy in representing key regional processes, as well as in terms of scale to match specific decisions.
2. Data credibility and uncertainty: which models to use for which applications, best practice for models and data selection for decision making

# Typology of use of climate information

1. Understand: 
    1. general management issues → awareness level
    2. more scientific understanding of hydroclimatic changes 
    3. capacity of the science
    
    **All types of information are equally important**
    
2. Motivate and communicate 
    1. Make the case for climate action. Communicate to stakeholders
    2. convince their bosses to approve projects
    3. communicate **uncertainties** when engaging with decision-makers and legal folks
    
    **Uncertainty is very important**
    
3. Inform
    1. scientific use → for impact modeling
    2. inform other fields of research like social science, plant science, political science
    3. reporting → international stakeholders
    
    **Usable and relevant metrics are important**
    
4. Plan 
    1. climate related plan and maps like flood maps + infrastructure and resource management plans
    2. fed to other plans
    
    **Data on decision-relevant information, extreme event , refined spatial and temporal are important  important**
    
5. Fund
    1. justify the need of money in **adaptation projects**
    
    **Financial implication of impacts and adaptation options**
    
6. Take action
    1. adjust operations on the fly 
        
        **Long-term change in decision-relevant metrics is most important**
        
    2. change rules, standards (e.g. building code), design requirements, e.g. IDF curves
        
        **Extreme event data**
        
    3. retrofit existing infrastructure
        
        **Extreme event data**
        
    4. undertake **adaptation** activities
        
        **Long-term change in decision-relevant metrics is most important**

# Intersection analysis:

**Type of information ❌ Type of use**

# Take away

1. Need to gauge the current situation of awareness and capacity of decision makers in using climate information.
2. Do the same typology for Thailand. The definitions of the typologies are not static. 
3. Intersect with the current data products and data development plan of DCCE and DDMP to see gaps
