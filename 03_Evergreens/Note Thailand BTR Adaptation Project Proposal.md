## Main Ideas of the Approach

Our proposal is grounded in a **system-thinking perspective**, treating adaptation not as a standalone activity but as part of a continuous, integrated national cycle. We aim to reinforce existing structures—such as the NAP process, sectoral planning, and M&E mechanisms—by linking project-level, sectoral, and national actions. The focus is on enhancing institutional practicality, data usability, and stakeholder ownership, while embedding gender and social inclusion throughout.

We want to move from

## Key Concepts

### 1. Adaptation Cycle: 
A new addition in this proposal is the development of a national adaptation planning, implementation, and reporting cycle. This will be built from desk reviews and stakeholder interviews, and used as a conceptual foundation for M&E design and reporting logic.

### Building on Existing Initiatives
The proposal avoids creating parallel structures. Instead, it enhances current processes, especially Thailand’s NAP implementation efforts and its evolving sectoral M&E approaches.

### Modular M&E Framework
- The M&E system is designed with modular components—each with standalone logic—that can be flexibly managed and updated. 
- It draws from existing data practices and links to budgeting, planning, and international reporting systems.

### Indicators
Indicators can be categorized into impact-based, outcome-based, and output-based indicators. Differentiating these indicators is very important to design the adaptation M&E framework that is relevant to stakeholders across scales. 

### Baseline Framework 
This is where the entire adaptation rationale stands on. Baselines could include vulnerability baseline, adaptive capacity baseline, climate risk baseline, and adaptation policy baselines. Again, the relevant baselines are project specific. They depend on what needs to be monitored



## Key Research Questions Investigated

1. What are the objectives of climate adaptation M&E, which is supposedly to be institutionalized by DCCE?
	The most important topic. What is this M&E for? Reporting? Tracking adaptation projects? Improve efficiency?

2. **How should Thailand’s national adaptation cycle be defined and operationalized?** 
    Our work seeks to identify entry points, roles, and feedback loops in national planning, implementation, and reporting practices.
    
3. **How can we align M&E of adaptation with Thailand’s sectoral and national planning systems without adding burdensome layers?**  
    We address this by mapping existing mechanisms, identifying linkages, and proposing low-friction integration points.
    
4. **What makes adaptation indicators useful and credible across scales?**  
    We define criteria for prioritizing indicators and document the rationale and data quality of each selected metric.
    
5. **What constitutes a robust baseline for adaptation?**  
    We define adaptation-relevant baseline types (e.g., vulnerability, adaptive capacity, risk) and build them into a structured, referenceable system.

6. **What is willingness to adopt of different stakeholders?**
	 propositions made in this project must be underpinned by the current willingness to adopt, which could be indirectly determined by the existing capacity and resources. Gauging the margin for new things is crucial for project success
