- From hazard-centric information to impact-related information

- National Meteorological and Hydrological Services  (NMHS)= National agency in charge of providing climate services

- NMHSs might think that providing climate impact information is out of their scope and there will be liability issue.

- False alarm needs to be mitigated.

- Risk plane: a new framework for looking at the data products and services and assessment frameworks

>**Hazard-Exposure Focus** answers: *Who or what might be impacted?*
**Hazard-Vulnerability Focus** answers: *How badly could those affected elements suffer?*


- Hazard-specific decision protocols and communication guidelines are important for users to interpret the information and uncertainties to avoid false expectations
- Impact-related service ⇒ individualized and decision relevant requirements
- Exposure and vulnerability data granularity can start from uniform ⇒ categorical ⇒  spatially explicit
- Consistent event definition is necessary for calibration of damage functions (temporal and spatial boundaries of extreme events)
- The data service design for impact-related information needs to engage with **boundary organizations (BO)** or data users (who currently use the climate information available to process and derive the actionable information) in the initial stage to disperse responsibilities of the development and encourage co-creation
- Partnerships with other agencies with specific expertise are key to creating tailor-made products that answer to user’s needs
- Metrics produced from the service could start with qualitative like **impact advisories**
- Quantitative assessments benefit from standardized and generalizable metric definitions, more rigid.
- Impact observations are needed ex0ante to calibrate vulnerability functions and ex-post to validate impact-related services
- Therefore, hazard-specific decision protocols and communication guidelines that clearly name the target group, how to interpret and deal with associated uncertainties, probabilities and the forecast skill must accompany each impact-related service
- Standardized event definition is essential for reproducibility
