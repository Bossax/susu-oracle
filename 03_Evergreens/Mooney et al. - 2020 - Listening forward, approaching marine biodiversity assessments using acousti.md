### Tag: soundscape

“levels of biodiversity are changing, largely at unknown rates” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 2)

“Conventional survey methods, such as visual and photographic/video surveys, are largely adapted from traditional terrestrial methods, yet they allow for only intermittent assessments of biodiversity and are only achievable when sites can be accessed (due to weather, depth and remoteness) and conditions are amenable to visual observation (e.g. not restricted by turbidity).” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 2)

“One of the fundamental assumptions about acoustic indices, making them appropriate for monitoring biological sounds, is that most biological sounds have distinct frequency and temporal properties which limit communication overlap” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 2)

“cryptic species, passive ocean acoustics has a vast advantage for species detection” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 5)

“Indeed, snapping shrimp are present and abundant in healthy and ‘degraded’ reefs, but their relative extents in both habitats are not yet well understood [56,108” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 8)

“Passive acoustics has an advantage over many other methods in that it can be cost-effective to observe over long timescales. In the ocean, sound cues travel efficiently, which is a benefit to detecting sounds but a challenge to mitigate masking lower amplitudes and less frequent sounds, which are critical to conservation monitoring” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 21)

### Tag: definition

“acoustic entropy index (H ), a calculation adapted from the Shannon’s diversity index, which aims to reflect the evenness of a signal’s amplitude over time and across the full range of frequencies” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 6)

“Acoustic complexity index (ACI), originally developed for analysing avian communities, summarizes fluctuations of sound within frequency bins across time, then summarizing these variations for the whole frequency range [87].” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 6)

“detectability (the relationship of what is present in a survey area versus what is actually detected” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 17)

### Tag: biodiversity

“Desiderà et al. [107] found a relationship between sound types (not indices) and taxonomic diversity. They compared years of visual census data from a Mediterranean Sea MPA to acoustic data and found a strong relationship between taxonomic diversity and acoustic diversity (but not acoustic indices)” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 7)

“acoustic entropy (H) and acoustic complexity (ACI) from their recordings and found no relationship to fish abundances (” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 7)

“Indeed, snapping shrimp are present and abundant in healthy and ‘degraded’ reefs, but their relative extents in both habitats are not yet well understood [56,108” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 8)

### Tag: bioacoustics

“cryptic species, passive ocean acoustics has a vast advantage for species detection” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 5)

“Snapping shrimp choruses can easily be heard by divers and through boat hulls, but living cryptically in goby holes, oyster reefs or deep in the spongocoel of select sponges, these shrimp are rarely seen” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 5)

“The temporal patterns, or rhythms, which can be compared to acoustic barcodes, contain information for discriminating sound types and eventually species” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 14)

### Tag: acoustic indices

“With respect to H and ACI—two prominent metrics—snapping shrimp sound patterns and other dominant biological sounds seemed to greatly affect the power of the index, suggesting that loud, frequent or omnipresent sounds could bias some indices” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 7)

“acoustic entropy (H) and acoustic complexity (ACI) from their recordings and found no relationship to fish abundances (” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 7)

“Buxton et al. also found that acoustic indices did not reliably predict bioacoustic activity in marine habitats. Suggesting such a result was due to the overlap of many biological signals with both the snapping shrimp and anthropogenic sounds” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 7)

### Tag: acoustic analysis

“Any assessment of the soundscape requires segregation of the three predominant source types: biological, anthropogenic and natural abiotic sounds. Separation of these three contributors should be an initial step of any soundscape evaluation.” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 10)

“It is essential to isolate anthropogenic and geophysical contributions to the soundscape, before acoustic measurements of the biological sources can be linked with local biodiversity” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 10)

“The biotic and abiotic sources may be separated by acquiring recordings that include the commencement and cessation of the source [126]” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 10)

“The diversity of transient sounds will be critical for the evaluation of biodiversity in species and behavioural levels.” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 11)

“By measuring the spectral average in a user-defined time window (e.g. 5 min interval), a long-term spectrogram can visualize the presence of various sound sources. Choruses are particularly visible in long-term spectrograms and power spectra as they represent energetic mass phenomena” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 14)

“Collating longterm spectrograms into a single power spectral density probability (PSDP) plot [206] can provide an overview of the levels of energy likely to occur at a given frequency” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 14)

“To facilitate the evaluation of acoustic diversity, clustering algorithms can be run on a long-term spectrogram. By grouping audio clips with similar spectral characteristics, a long-term spectrogram can be summarized into a limited number of audio clusters” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 14)

“Another option is to integrate soundscape metrics that are less sensitive to unwanted noise with clustering to improve the content interpretation of long-duration environmental recordings” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 14)

(Mooney et al., 2020, p. 16) Clustering biological sounds to analyse acoustic diversity

“Many fish and aquatic invertebrate sounds are found among the low-frequency noise of their habitats; noise reduction related to those signals of interest is key to proper sound detections” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 18)

“integration with these techniques in the analysis of marine soundscapes should maximize the potential deliverables regarding the acoustic behaviour of soniferous fishes and invertebrates, vital biological sources important to the variability of marine soundscapes” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 18) Deep learning, Species-specific acoustic NN, cross-correlation, detection of frequency contour to name a few

### Tag: interpretation

“Their success has been variable and their repeatability should be assessed, but it seems that a combination of acoustic indices (rather than a single metric) is more effective at predicting bioacoustic activity [39]” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 3)

“Long-term recordings may be particularly useful to compare biodiversity levels before and after events,” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 5)

“Early work suggested sound pressure levels were associated with coral cover, s” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 6)

“Desiderà et al. [107] found a relationship between sound types (not indices) and taxonomic diversity. They compared years of visual census data from a Mediterranean Sea MPA to acoustic data and found a strong relationship between taxonomic diversity and acoustic diversity (but not acoustic indices)” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 7)

“Quantification of the frequency diversity may be associated with diversity in both species and behavioural states” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 11)

### Tag: best practice

“establishing data collection requirements and sampling regimes that are appropriate for the variability they attempt to quantify.” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 7)

“Given the lower probability of detecting rare and transient sounds [154,155,184], repeated surveys, multiple methods and longer-term observations are also key methods to improve species detections and quality of richness estimations” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 11)

“it is, therefore, highly preferably to record multiple cycles of the temporal variability that is to be quantified and consider this alongside the goal of the indices to be used” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 12)

“Another option is to integrate soundscape metrics that are less sensitive to unwanted noise with clustering to improve the content interpretation of long-duration environmental recordings” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 14)

“Because acoustic behaviours are often driven by environmental factors or geophysical conditions, spatio-temporal replicates selected to assess variation between biodiversity or habitat characteristics must have similar geophysical conditions (e.g. salinity, temperature, oxygen cycles, currents tidal cycle). Given that true natural replicates are challenging, sites may be better differentiated by regression-type analyses of gradient differences (i.e. a range of biodiversity or habitat conditions) rather than forced groupings” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 17)

“we recommend sufficient recording time to include and identify the cycles in soniferous behaviours of interest that may be site- and species-specific, rather than shortterm or subsampled recording, such as the same period of each day” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 17)

“while many covariates will differ between terrestrial and marine environments, perhaps we can apply the analyses frameworks (such as effective sampling distance, species heterogeneity, parsing of habitat types and by species) to improve the reliability of marine acoustic diversity assessments” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 17)

“Propagation-related aspects (depth, local bathymetry, substrate) should be identified, and evaluation of weather and other noise sources, especially when comparing among sites” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 17)

“Multiple methods to count animals and species greatly support biodiversity measurements. These are noted above and include visual surveys, measures of rugosity and quantifying physical (currents) and biogeochemical parameters” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 17)

“Pilot data are valuable in any study, and bioacoustics is no exception. These data should be made available as electronic supplementary material to guide and support why measurement decisions were made.” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 17)

“noise reduction is vital to improving biodiversity analyses and reliability of data.” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 18)

“Further, instrument noise of the recording system is a crucial parameter and should be reported.” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 18)

“One must try to understand what sources are influencing this variability, or at least the range of variability, so that proper recording guidelines (such as timeframe of observation) are followed” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 21)

### Tag: limitation

“In fact, many marine studies have shown that there is not a clear relationship between biodiversity and the terrestrial-derived acoustic indices” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 7)

“With respect to H and ACI—two prominent metrics—snapping shrimp sound patterns and other dominant biological sounds seemed to greatly affect the power of the index, suggesting that loud, frequent or omnipresent sounds could bias some indices” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 7)

“acoustic entropy (H) and acoustic complexity (ACI) from their recordings and found no relationship to fish abundances (” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 7)

“Buxton et al. also found that acoustic indices did not reliably predict bioacoustic activity in marine habitats. Suggesting such a result was due to the overlap of many biological signals with both the snapping shrimp and anthropogenic sounds” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 7)

“Not all species produce sounds at the same intensity and, depending on habitat, not all sounds travel to the recording device in the same manner.” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 8)

“there may be a small number of species that dominate the soundscape, mask other sounds and impact acoustic diversity assessments.” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 8)

“the clustering performance may be biased when spectral representations are corrupted by non-biological sources” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 14)

“While no clear methods seem successful to extract biodiversity data from acoustic recordings, and applications of even an array of (terrestrial) acoustic diversity indices seem ineffective” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 18)

“We see these tools as having great potential, but we suggest a cautious approach to applying current acoustic indices to assess marine biodiversity. Yet, with key preliminary data, an initial understanding of the patterns and variability of a habitat, and new analytical tools, there is substantial promise in quantifying marine bioacoustic diversity and supporting management needs” (Mooney et al., 2020, p. 21)
