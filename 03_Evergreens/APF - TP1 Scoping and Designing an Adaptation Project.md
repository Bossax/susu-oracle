# Definitions
Adaptation is a process by which strategies to moderate, cope with and take advantage of the consequences of *climate events* are enhanced, developed and implemented.
#Question there are non-event climate perils. Or should we frame everything as events?

An #Adaptation_baseline is a comprehensive description of adaptations that are in place to cope with current climate. The baseline may be both qualitative and quantitative, but should be operationally defined with a limited ==set of parameters== (indicators). #Risk_layering #Risk_management #Risk_reduction 

# 1. Scope project and define objectives
## 1.2 Prioritize the key systems
The questions in Annex A.1 may be helpful in the prioritisation process
can be identified from existing vulnerability assessments and determined along various dimensions such as sector, region or climate hazard. 
Use risk assessment to prioritize too
>[!info] Thailand's prioritization reflects in the structure of NAP approach which defines economic sectors as the main dimension

## 1.4 Define the project objectives and expected outcomes
- When setting objectives and expected outcomes, think about evaluation criteria at this step too.
## 1.5  Develop a communication plan
- ==is a communication plan part of Thailand's climate adaptation project components?==
	=> The project will only be effective if the results are effectively communicated with key stakeholders, decision-makers and the public

An adaptation project for developing and implementing adaptation strategies, policies and measures may be designed and carried out, using some or all of the concepts of the APF.

# 3. Review and synthesize existing information on vulnerability and adaptation
## 3.1 Review and synthesize existing information on vulnerability and climate risk, based on previous studies, expert opinion, and policy context
Qualitatively understand the states of vulnerability and climate risk
## 3.2 Describe adaptation policies and measures in place that influence the ability to successfully cope with climate variability, including the effectiveness of those policies and measures
Qualitatively understand the state of adaptation
## 3.3 Develop indicators of vulnerability and adaptive capacity
- the project baseline describes how well adapted the system is to current climatic conditions.
- Indicators chosen to describe the baseline should be used during project monitoring and evaluation whenever possible

# 4. Project design
Select approach and methods to: 
1. Assess future vulnerability and adaptation
2. Characterise future climate-related risks
3.  Assess future socio-economic conditions and prospects
4. Assess capacity to adapt
5. Characterise uncertainties

## Approaches of Adaptation projects
These approaches are **complementary rather than mutually exclusive**

| Approach                      | Focus                                                                                                                                                                           | When Preferred                                                                                                                        | Nature of Assessment                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| #Hazards_based_approach       | Estimating how vulnerability changes over time and space due to these hazards. Assesses current vulnerability/risk and uses climate scenarios for projections.                  | Probabilities of climate hazards can be constrained, main drivers of impacts are known, and chain of consequences is well understood. | Largely exploratory, predicting specific outcomes.                                       |
| #Vulnerability_based_approach | Understanding a priority system's vulnerability, recognizing current vulnerability reflects development conditions and sensitivity to current climate.                          | Probability of the hazard is unconstrained, many drivers of change, and multiple pathways and feedbacks lead to vulnerability.        | More normative, proposing a future outcome and assessing risk of achieving/exceeding it. |
| #Adaptive_capacity_approach   | Proposing ways to increase (or lessen) adaptive capacity to better cope with climate variability and change. Enhances ability of human systems to adjust.                       | When the goal is to enhance a system's inherent ability to respond and adjust to climate conditions.                                  | Focused on system adjustment and resilience building.                                    |
| #Policy_based_approach        | Testing a policy's robustness under climate change or whether it adequately manages anticipated risk. Assesses potential effectiveness of policies in future climate scenarios. | When evaluating the suitability and effectiveness of policies, strategies, or measures in a changing climate context.                 | Evaluative, assessing policy performance against climate change.                         |
