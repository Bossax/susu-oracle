 **Monitoring and Accountability Framework (MAF)** for Accredited Entities (AEs) is a crucial instrument of the Green Climate Fund (GCF). It was adopted by the GCF Board and is detailed in Annex I to decision B.11/10.

# Core Purpose

The MAF is designed to:
1. Ensure the **compliance of AEs** with their accreditation standards over time.
2. Enable the **effective implementation** of each GCF-funded project and programme by the AE.
3. Provide guidance on **responsibilities, tools, and processes** related to monitoring and reporting results from GCF investments.

# Key Actors and Responsibilities
Monitoring and accountability under the MAF involve several actors with specific roles:

1. **Accredited Entities (AEs)**: Primarily responsible for implementing the project in compliance with the funded activity agreement. ==They are also primarily responsible for monitoring and evaluating their funded activities and reporting to the GCF.==
2. ***Secretariat***: Responsible for implementing the MAF. They manage the system and report to the Board.
3. **National Designated Authorities (NDAs) or Focal Points**: Play an important role in accordance with guidelines for their selection and establishment. They ensure consistency of funding proposals with national plans and strategies and are encouraged to organize annual participatory reviews for local stakeholders.
4. **GCF Accountability Units**: Play a role according to their terms of reference.
5. **Direct beneficiaries**, **project-affected people and communities**, and **other local actors** (e.g., local governments, civil society organizations, NGOs, private sector) are also involved.

# Components of the MAF
The MAF is built on two main components:

1. **Monitoring of AE Compliance**:
    - AEs are required to provide an **annual self-assessment** of their compliance with GCF fiduciary standards, environmental and social safeguards (ESS), and gender policy.
    - At the midpoint of the accreditation period, the Secretariat undertakes a **light-touch mid-term review** of AE compliance performance.
    - **Ad hoc compliance reviews** may be initiated if needed.
    - The Secretariat reports to the Board annually on the consolidated results of these assessments.

2. **Monitoring and Evaluation of Individual Funded Activities**:
    - AEs are required to submit **Annual Performance Reports (APRs)**, including financial management reports, during the project/programme implementation period.
    - AEs also submit an **interim evaluation report** and a **final evaluation report** for each funded activity. These evaluations assess performance against GCF investment framework criteria, including financial/economic performance.
    - Post-implementation APR submissions might be required.
    - **Participatory monitoring** involving communities and local stakeholders is encouraged at all stages of the project/programme cycle.
    - The Secretariat may undertake **additional ad hoc checks**, including site visits, to follow up on AE reports.

# Reporting requirement
    
1. **Annual Performance Reports (APRs)**: AEs are required to submit APRs, including financial management reports, throughout the project/programme implementation period.
	1. **Content**: APRs must include a narrative report on implementation progress based on the logical framework from the funding proposal, an assessment of ongoing performance against GCF investment framework criteria, and **updates on indicators**. They also require a report on environmental and social safeguards (ESS) and gender. AEs must provide information on impact indicators and update on the methods and assumptions used for each indicator.
	2. **Alignment**: APR content should align with the [[Evergreens/GCF Results Management Framework]](RMF) and its [[Evergreens/GCF Performance Measurement Framework]] (PMFs) for adaptation and mitigation.
	3. **Post-implementation**: Submission of APRs might also be required during the post-implementation period.
2. **Interim and Final Evaluation Reports**: AEs must submit these for each funded activity. These reports assess the activity's performance against GCF investment framework criteria, including financial/economic performance.
3. **Annual Self-Assessment of Compliance**: AEs are required to provide an annual self-assessment of their compliance with GCF fiduciary standards, ESS, and gender policy.
4. **Participatory Monitoring**: AEs should include participatory monitoring, involving communities and local stakeholders, at all stages of the project/programme cycle.

# Risk-based Monitoring Approach

1. The Secretariat develops an **early warning system based on "risk flags"** to assess risks related to the project itself ("project risk flags") and the overall performance of the AE ("AE risk flags").
2. Risk flags are reported as part of the GCF risk dashboard presented periodically to the Board.
3. The system uses a risk-based approach to decide on ad hoc checks, and a small number of random checks are also conducted annually.
4. An annual review is conducted on a proportion of projects and programmes, focusing on those with outstanding accreditation conditions, risk flags, or high environmental/social risk.

## Incentives and Remedial Measures
1. If AE compliance or performance issues are identified, the Secretariat assigns a risk flag and invites the AE to agree on an **action programme of immediate remedial measures**, including deadlines.
2. Capacity-building support may be provided to the AE to prevent recurrence.
3. If issues remain unresolved, additional measures may be taken, such as **partial or total suspension of disbursements or commitments**, reclaiming funds, or suspending/cancelling/downgrading AE accreditation.
4. The GCF may include provisions for "step-in rights" in agreements to preserve business continuity on existing projects if an AE's accreditation is changed.

## Re-accreditation
1. The risk-based approach also applies to the **re-accreditation of AEs** at the end of their five-year accreditation period.
2. The Secretariat and Accreditation Panel review performance reports, particularly risk flags incurred, to make a recommendation to the Board.
3. Re-accreditation decisions consider the AE's overall portfolio evolution towards low-emission and climate-resilient development pathways.

# Tools

1. The GCF plans to develop an **integrated online platform** to manage large volumes of information efficiently.
2. This platform is envisioned to include a **portfolio management system** for capturing documents, a real-time database of risk flags, and integration of monitoring and reporting toolkits for online time-based and event-based reporting.
3. It would also feature an **interactive portal** for communication among stakeholders and a **knowledge management platform** for public disclosure of documents.
4. Where online access is limited, in-country consultation and information dissemination would complement these tools.

The MAF is highly relevant to results management and defines roles, responsibilities, and instruments for monitoring and reporting GCF investments. However, the RMF itself is silent on risk management, which is addressed by the MAF. There are operational challenges, such as inconsistencies in reporting methodologies, and a lack of clear guidance on how the MAF, IF, and RMF are meant to integrate for project design and management for results.
