# Synthesis

This note synthesizes the current status of knowledge of comprehensive risk management. After a few months of grappling with a multitude of frameworks and technical terms, I have come to a sound understanding of the theoretical framework of comprehensive risk management (CRM). In this context, CRM is a comprehensive framework which consists of inputs, outputs, processes, and relationships among them which dictate the flow of information. CRM encompasses often-dealt-separately fields including risk assessment, disaster risk reduction, climate mitigation, climate adaptation, decision-making, financing, and evaluation into a homogenous narrative.

Framework for comprehensive risk assessment and planning in the context of climate change - **UNDRR (2022)** _“Technical Guidance on Comprehensive Risk Assessment and Planning in the Context of Climate Change”,_ **United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction.**

There are two main components: 1) risk assessment and 2) decision-making. The risk assessment is fundamental to management since the results provide information on the risks associated with a changing climate.

# _Let’s talk about the definition of risk…._

In the context of climate change, risk refers to the threat posed to both natural ecosystems and human systems. It emphasizes the _negative impacts_ resulting from such threats.

> [!important] Risk is the potential for adverse consequences for human and ecological systems

This new perspective of _risk_ within the climate change agenda must compete with the well-established frameworks in disaster risk management. _Risk_ from the DRM perspective is commonly described as _risk from a hazard_. It can be translated to the probability of the hazard’s occurrence in a certain area.

> To align DRR and CCA, the definition of risk in the DRM community needs to shift to being more impact-focused

Another important characteristic of risk in the climate change conversation is that it is _==**value-based**==_. Since risk is defined as an adverse consequence, what is considered adverse is subject to societal perception. For climate-related risk, there is no universal scale of risk levels; what is considered low, moderate, and high is context-specific and needs to be made explicit by the stakeholders.

# _How is risk assessed?_

The risk assessment approaches vary with the knowledge of the ==**probability**== and ==**consequences**== of climate-related risks. Uncertainties tend to grow with time in the future; the farther in the future, the less we know about the probability and consequences of the risk. Start with the present and near future time horizons. This is the zone where we have the best knowledge (or at least data is lying around out there). ==**Disaster risk management**== has long established an analytical risk assessment approach using probabilistic modeling to quantify the probability of occurrence of climate-related hazards using the _==return period==_ concept. The consequences are also known with quantified magnitude in monetary terms, such as _==Expected Annual Loss==_ (EAL).

A purely analytical approach is not suitable and even unattainable for medium—and long-term risk assessment due to unquantifiable uncertainties. These uncertainties stem from many sources and have different depths.

1. Uncertainty of future emission scenarios: Emission scenarios are highly tied to social and economic development, which makes assigning probability to them unsuitable.
2. Uncertainty of climate model: the uncertainty of climate models is quantifiable under a given emission scenario.
3. Uncertainty of hazard model: this element of uncertainty is also quantifiable.
4. Uncertainty of exposure and vulnerability: these elements in the risk assessment framework are difficult to quantify at the current state, not to mention predicting them. The uncertainties are unknown.
5. Uncertainty of the interactions among risk elements: a single hazard can cause cascading impacts that pervade through serval sectors and systems. The impacts from multiple hazards form a complex impact chain that is difficult to assess analytically.

Three CRM approaches—analytical CRM, iterative CRM, and adaptive CRM—for dealing with climate-related risk. **Schinko et al.**, _A methodological framework to operationalize climate risk management: managing sovereign climate-related extreme event risk in Austria._

## **Risk assessment approaches**

1. Analytical/quantitative approach: this is based on the probabilistic catastrophe model which is well-established in the field of disaster risk management.
2. Semi-quantitative approach: this is an indicator/index-based approach. It combines various factors from all risk elements which normally require ‘damage functions’ or ‘impact models’ to quantify the relationships between the elements. Instead, expert judgment can substitute analytical impact models.
3. Qualitative approach: depends on expert elicitation process and systemic reviews. This is to fill in data gaps.

# _From single hazard risk assessment to comprehensive risk assessment_

Climate change management stresses the assessment of compounding risks caused by multiple climate drivers and non-climate drivers. The non-climate drivers such as geological hazards can drive the changes in exposure and vulnerability, biological, chemical hazards, and societal and environmental changes.

**Impact Chain Analysis**

The technique for conceptualizing comprehensive risk assessment. A compound event, an event where multiple hazards take place simultaneously, is a starting point of the analysis. The process is a participatory process that can serve as a basis for discussion and risk assessment with hybrid approaches. During the assessment, indicators can be used to inform the stakeholders of the sense of importance of each risk factor. Present hazard maps accompanied by climate scenarios and **narratives** can also guide the conversation.

> [!important] The natural ecosystems that are the subject of interest in **nature risk management** are a component of this framework. This is where climate risk and nature risk overlap

DCCE has commissioned researchers from Thammasat University to write an impact chain analysis manual for their local staff to implement in planning.

# Risk assessment workflow

1. Scoping: prepare contextual information, goals, the boundary of the analysis, e.g. spatial unit., establish risk criteria Link to the decision-making
2. Risk identification: look into past disaster data, synthesize intelligence from climate impact study, indicate hazards of interest, systems of interest
3. Risk analysis: conceptualize impact chain, transmission channels, vulnerability (lack of …), analyze interrelation among risk elements in various systems (ecosystems, human systems), synthesize the outcomes of the risk assessment, describe potential adverse impact as risk, format the results to fit the audience groups, classify risk into systems and sectors.
4. Risk evaluation: compare the results from the risk analysis with risk criteria (low, medium, high/ acceptable, tolerable, intolerable) to determine action (risk treatment)

  

**Outputs from the risk assessment**

Impacts across systems and sectors with description, risk level, and action priority.

  
## 💥 The issue of the qualitative nature of climate risk

Since the climate risk assessment result will be mixed between quantitative and qualitative parts, the decision-making for risk reduction must also adjust to the available information. Research shows that 100% quantifiable impacts are not necessary to justify investment in adaptation. However, the basis of decision-making needs to be obtained through political negotiation.

# 👥_Decision-making space_

Now that we have the knowledge of what could happen, the next step is to plan the measures to deal with the risks. A concept of ‘_==risk layering==_’ can be used to design measures and resource allocation schemes for the measures (financing)

Let’s go over the measure categories that we are familiar with

1. Climate mitigation: act of reducing anthropogenic GHG emission to mitigate the underlying driver of climate risk; anthropogenic GHGs.
2. Disaster risk reduction: reduce vulnerability to disaster events
3. Climate change adaptation: reduce vulnerability to long-term changes in ecosystems due to increasing temperature

These categories seem to operate separately and have different objectives, but they are just different approaches to tackling different risk layers.

  

## 🧱 Risk layering

Mechler (2014) proposes a concept of **risk layering** based on frequency and magnitude of the risk. It is first applied to disaster risk.

![[Mechler (2014) risk layering.png|Mechler (2014) risk layering.png]]

Layered disaster risk management - Mechler 2015, _Managing unnatural disaster risk from climate extremes_

  

- **Low-risk layer (high frequency, low impact)** : risk reduction is the most cost-efficient
- **Medium-risk layer (medium frequency, medium impact)** : risk reduction might not be able to cope with the risk and there will be a residual risk that could be transferred through risk financing (otherwise it is absorbed by the affected)
- **High-risk layer (low frequency, high impact)** : absorbed by regional and international aid

Another diagram that modifies the above one to suit climate risk is below

Comprehensive climate risk layering approach and associated finance options and sources. **Mechler 2021**, _Finance for Loss and Damage: a comprehensive risk analytical approach_

  

The **DRR** activities, especially in the _==build-back better==_ phase, significantly contribute to incremental risk reduction (_State and trends in Climate Adaptation Finance 2024_). The ==build-back better== can push the limit to adaptation outward by taking climate risk assessment results into account. However, to expand the soft limit toward the hard limit, **CCA** plays an important role. This is called transformative climate adaptation, which needs long-term planning.

Financing for **DRR** activities will have a shorter feedback loop for evaluation since it deals with ex-post residual risks from disaster databases. **CCA** activities should focus on medium and long-term transformative measures. Both activities are under _**Finance for risk management**._

The goal of climate mitigation is to reduce the overall risk of climate change. Thus, it falls into the risk reduction activity. Due to different M&E metrics, climate mitigation has been the focus of mainstream _**Climate Finance**._

Above the limit to adaptation is residual risk, which should be tackled by _**risk financing**_. The financing instruments are different from financing for risk reductions which include insurance products.

Risk above the hard limits falls into Loss and Damage realm where negotiation is ongoing. The conceptualization of the **residual risk** deserves a separate discussion. For climate adaptation, we will focus on lower-risk layers.

> [!important] **Conclusion**
> 
> - ==Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation serve the same goal by tackling with low-risk layers but target different time frames.==
> - ==They fall within the same decision-making spectrum based on the risk layering concept but target different time frames==
> - ==The financing instruments could be the same, but the monitoring and evaluation might be different.==
> - Climate mitigation is also a risk reduction activity. It is the fundamental of climate risk management.
> - ==Lower layer residual risk is tackled by risk financing==
> - ==Higher layer residual risk is tackled by loss and damage financing==

## Integration in the planning

informed by the analysis of exposure and vulnerability in the risk analysis stage

**Principles**

- risk as a value-based concept
- focus on system risks to human and natural ecosystems
- engage with multiple stakeholders from multidisciplinary backgrounds to identify and select measures to reduce risk (exposure and vulnerability)
- use risk tolerance concept to guide the decision-making on measures
- apply ecosystem-based approach
- engage at-risk population during risk evaluation
- tailor communication strategies for different objectives

  

## **Entry points for DRR and CCA**

**DRR entry point**

- During the recovery and reconstruction phases in the disaster management cycle. The damaged physical assets are the target of the intervention.
- During the preparedness phase. Target social vulnerability.

**CCA entry point**:

- During the **recovery and reconstruction phases** as well. Target the systems and sub-systems that are not traditionally covered by DRM such as natural ecosystems, social vulnerability.
- During the development planning phase. Adopt the requirements of the risk reduction measures resulted from the Comprehensive Risk Assessment and include in the budgeting process.
