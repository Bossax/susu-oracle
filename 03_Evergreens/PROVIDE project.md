The PROVIDE project is a Horizon Europe-funded initiative focused on enhancing our understanding and ability to respond to climate change risks, particularly those associated with "overshoot" scenarios.1 Here's a breakdown of what it does and how it differs from some past climate research:

# **What the PROVIDE Project Does:**

- **Focus on Overshoot Scenarios:**
    - A key distinguishing feature is its emphasis on climate "overshoot" scenarios. These are situations where global temperatures temporarily exceed targets like the 1.5°C limit of the Paris Agreement, before ideally being brought back down.2
    - PROVIDE aims to assess the risks and potential irreversibility of impacts associated with these overshoot scenarios.
- **Development of the Climate Risk Dashboard:**
    - The project has created an interactive online tool, the PROVIDE Climate Risk Dashboard, which allows users to explore future climate change impacts across various scales (global, national, and city-level).3
    - This dashboard provides detailed information on potential impacts on areas like:
        - Terrestrial climate
        - Marine climate
        - Urban heat stress
        - Biodiversity
        - Cryosphere (ice and permafrost)
        - Economic damages
- **Emphasis on Adaptation:**
    - PROVIDE also focuses on developing methodologies to "overshoot-proof" adaptation strategies, helping policymakers and planners understand how to build resilience in the face of potential temperature overshoots.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:**
    - The project actively involves stakeholders in the development and refinement of its tools and research, ensuring that the information produced is relevant and usable for decision-making.

# **Differences From Past Climate Research:**

- **Overshoot Focus:**
    - While climate research has long examined various warming scenarios, PROVIDE's specific focus on the risks of temporary temperature overshoots is a more recent and critical area of inquiry.
- **Interactive and Accessible Tools:**
    - The Climate Risk Dashboard aims to make complex climate data more accessible to a wider audience, including policymakers, urban planners, and the general public.4 This emphasis on user-friendly tools is a step forward in climate communication.
- **Integration of Multiple Sectors:**
    - PROVIDE seeks to integrate data and analysis across multiple sectors (e.g., climate, ecosystems, socio-economics), providing a more holistic view of climate risks.
- **Adaptation Focus:**
    - While much climate research has focused on mitigation, this project places a very strong emphasis on adaptation, and how to adapt to situations where climate goals are temporarily exceeded.

In essence, the PROVIDE project is designed to provide timely and relevant information to help societies navigate the increasingly complex challenges of climate change, with a particular emphasis on the risks associated with exceeding global temperature targets.
