The concept of "baseline" is fundamental to the Adaptation Policy Framework (APF) and is discussed throughout the provided sources, particularly in the context of **assessing current conditions, measuring change, and informing future strategies**. The sources define and differentiate several types of baselines, emphasizing their role in grounding adaptation efforts in existing realities and tracking progress.

### Executive Summary

- A key innovation of the APF is the **development of an adaptation baseline** and situating adaptation in the current policy context.
- The APF is "firmly grounded in the present," working from current climate variability and extremes, and assessing recent climate experiences to link the near-term to the medium- and longer-terms.

### User's Guidebook

- **The Adaptation Policy Framework**
    - The APF is about practice rather than theory, starting with information countries already possess on vulnerable systems like agriculture, water resources, public health, and disaster management. It **builds on what is already known** rather than "reinventing the wheel".

### Technical Paper 1: Scoping and Designing an Adaptation Project

- **1.3. Key concepts**
    - An **adaptation baseline** is a "comprehensive description of adaptations that are in place to cope with current climate". It can be qualitative and quantitative and should be operationally defined with limited parameters (indicators).
    - **Baselines** are used in two distinct ways in the APF:
        1. #project_baseline A description of the project's starting point
			- These are **site-specific** and **duration-limited**, characterized by quantitative or qualitative indicators. 
			- A **project baseline** can take the form of a #vulnerability_baseline (TP3), a #climate_risk_baseline (TPs 4 and 5), an #adaptive_capacity_baseline  (TP7), or an #adaptation_baseline  (TP6). They are used in monitoring and evaluation to measure change and effectiveness.
			- e.g. Vulnerability 
				1. who is vulnerable to what
				2. what is currently being done to reduce that vulnerability
        2. A #futur_baseline or #reference_scenario: Provides a plausible future picture without adaptation, for comparing different adaptation strategies.
    
- **1.4.3. Review and synthesize existing information on vulnerability and adaptation**
    - Synthesizing prior work on vulnerability and adaptation helps develop a #project_baseline . This baseline is crucial for considering future vulnerability and adaptation options and for measuring future progress.
    - The **project baseline** describes how well adapted the system is to current climatic conditions.
    - The APF outlines **four main approaches to baseline development**:
        - TP3 describes methods for constructing a **vulnerability baseline**.
        - TP4 provides a flowchart for assessing the **current climate risk baseline**.
        - TP6 outlines the development of an **adaptation policy baseline** (synonymous with adaptation baseline) and explains how to construct **baseline indicators** of socio-economic conditions.
        - TP7 describes selecting indicators for defining the **adaptive capacity baseline**.
    - Developing indicators and baselines is a key part of project design, helping to account for and minimize uncertainties.

### Technical Paper 3: Assessing Vulnerability for Climate Adaptation

- **3.3. Key concepts: About vulnerability**
    - Vulnerability in this TP corresponds to present conditions, referred to as the #vulnerability_baseline defined by socio-economic conditions. It can be extended to the future as a reference scenario of socio-economic vulnerability.
- **3.4.2. Activity 2: Identifying vulnerable groups: Exposure and assessment boundaries**
    - A multi-dimensional **baseline of vulnerability** includes target vulnerable groups
	    - socio-economic characteristics
	    - natural resources
	    - climatic risks
	    - institutional processes for planning adaptation.
    - The output is a set of #vulnerability_indicator and identified vulnerable livelihoods, which together form a #vulnerability_baseline of present conditions**.

### Technical Paper 4: Assessing Current Climate Risks

- **4.4.6. Defining the climate risk baseline**
    - A #climate_risk_baseline is an "initial risk assessment at time = t0, or even t-10, which provides the reference on which future risks are measured".
    - It **differs** from a general climate baseline (e.g., 1961–90).
    - This baseline can be tied to a period with available socio-economic and climate data, or when specific infrastructure or policy was implemented. For example, a climate-risk baseline can use historical climate data with modern management rules to assess current risks.

### Technical Paper 6: Assessing Current and Changing Socio-economic Conditions

- **6.4. Guidance on characterising current and changing socio-economic conditions**
    - Analysis of current socio-economic conditions, including **natural resource management** ==practices== and ==changes== over the last 10-50 years due to climate variability, constitutes the #Adaptation_baseline 
    - The first storyline for future scenarios is a **reference scenario**, which projects "current socio-economic conditions" into the future without considering climate change.
- **6.4.5. Characterizing current adaptations**
    - **Current adaptations** for coping with today’s climate constitute the **adaptation baseline**. This is a "comprehensive description of adaptations that are in place to cope with current climate" and serves as the analytical starting point for projects using the policy-based approach. #adaptation_baseline 

### Technical Paper 7: Assessing and Enhancing Adaptive Capacity

>[!warning] #adaptive_capacity_indicator
>Could be difficult to measure quantitatively


- **7.3.7. Indicators of adaptive capacity**
    - For projects using the #adaptive_capacity_approach , an #adaptive_capacity_baseline can be developed, typically from **qualitative** indicators ==due to the difficulty in direct measurement.==
- **7.4.2. Component 2: Assessing current vulnerability**
    - Current socio-economic, political, and environmental conditions represent the #project_baseline 
### Technical Paper 9: Continuing the Adaptation Process

- **9.3.4. Learning by doing**
    - The process of learning by doing involves constructing a **revised adaptation baseline** that describes how a system would have performed without the implemented adaptation. This **revised adaptation baseline** is more accurate than the initial one from Component 2, as it's based on ==actual experience and the evolution of context==.
    
>[!note] #adaptation_baseline >> #vulnerability_baseline 

- **9.4.1. Establishing the monitoring and evaluation framework**
    - Socio-economic drivers that frame the **adaptation baseline** must be monitored. Evaluation interprets trends and changes relative to **baselines**.

### Glossary of Terms

- **Adaptation baseline**: "includes a description of adaptations to current climate that are already in place (e.g., existing risk mitigation policies and programmes)". Also referred to as an **adaptation policy baseline**.
- **Adaptive-capacity baseline**: "includes a description of the current capacity within a priority system to cope with and adapt to climate variability".
- **Baselines**: Used in two distinct ways:
    1. **Project baseline**: "describes where the project is starting from e.g., who is vulnerable to what, and what is currently being done to reduce that vulnerability". These are site-specific and used for monitoring and evaluation. It can take the form of a **vulnerability baseline**, a **climate risk baseline**, an **adaptive capacity baseline**, or an **adaptation (policy) baseline**.
    2. **Future baseline or reference scenario**: Provides a plausible future picture without considering climate change. They are longer-term and used for strategic planning and comparing different adaptation strategies.
- **Climate risk baseline**: "includes a description of the current climate risk within the priority system (i.e., the probability of a climate hazard combined with the system’s current vulnerability)".
- **Reference scenario**: An "internally coherent description of a possible future without consideration of climate change". It serves as a **future baseline**.
- **Vulnerability baseline**: "includes a description of current vulnerabilities to climate variability and events".
