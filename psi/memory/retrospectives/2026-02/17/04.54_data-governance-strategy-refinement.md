# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-17
**Start/End**: 02:19 - 04:54 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~155 min
**Focus**: Refine and finalize data governance implementation strategies for the DCCE-CRDB project, specifically adapting to DCCE's organizational context.
**Type**: Strategy / Planning

## Session Summary
Session #4 of 3 in this project (0-day streak)
This session focused on synthesizing key insights from existing DCCE-CRDB project artifacts, particularly regarding data governance and organizational capacity. Two distinct data governance implementation strategies were proposed: a Feature-Driven, Value-First approach and a Compliance-First, Foundation-Forward approach. Based on user feedback concerning DCCE's project-driven budget cycles, low data literacy, and limited incentives for compliance, the Feature-Driven strategy was refined and selected as the primary approach. The alternative strategy was archived for future reference. The task concluded with the finalization of the chosen implementation plan, which prioritizes rapid delivery of tangible features while incrementally embedding essential governance practices.

## Timeline
*   **02:19**: Started `/recap` to get session context.
*   **02:20**: Reviewed DCCE-CRDB project file structure using `list_files`.
*   **02:20**: Drafted and saved the initial data governance strategies document to `plans/2026-02-17_data-governance-strategy.md`.
*   **03:41**: Updated the todo list to reflect progress and planned next steps.
*   **03:48**: Attempted to `write_to_file` the initial strategies, but encountered an error due to a malformed diff block.
*   **04:00**: Applied `apply_diff` to modify the document and refine the strategies, incorporating initial user feedback.
*   **04:00**: User provided critical context about DCCE's operational environment, including project-driven budget cycles, low data literacy, and lack of compliance incentives.
*   **04:00**: Updated todo list to reflect the need to refine the feature-driven strategy based on new context.
*   **04:00**: Attempted to apply diff again, but encountered an error about the search content not matching.
*   **04:01**: Read the file to get the latest content.
*   **04:01**: Applied diff successfully to refine the Feature-Driven strategy, incorporating the detailed DCCE context and outlining specific integrations of governance within each phase.
*   **04:04**: Saved the refined Feature-Driven strategy to `src/01_Projects/2025-11_DCCE-CRDB/output/Implementation_Strategy_Feature-Driven.md`.
*   **04:04**: Archived the Compliance-First strategy to `src/01_Projects/2025-11_DCCE-CRDB/notes/Alternative_Strategy_Compliance-First.md`.
*   **04:04**: Updated todo list to mark all tasks as complete.
*   **04:04**: Signaled task completion and suggested switching to code mode.
*   **04:52**: Started `/rrr` for retrospective.

## Files Modified
