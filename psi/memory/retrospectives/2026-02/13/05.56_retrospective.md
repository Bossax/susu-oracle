# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-13
**Start/End**: 05:55 - 05:56 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~1 min
**Focus**: Executing /rrr command
**Type**: Research

## Session Summary
This session was dedicated to executing the `/rrr` command to generate a retrospective. Initial attempts to read pulse context failed due to command incompatibility on Windows (using `cat` instead of `type`). After correcting the command to `type`, it was confirmed that pulse data files (`project.json` and `heartbeat.json`) do not exist yet. The retrospective directory was successfully created, and this retrospective is now being written.

## Timeline
- 05:55 SEAST: Started /rrr command, initialized todo list.
- 05:55 SEAST: Attempted to read pulse context using `cat`, failed.
- 05:56 SEAST: Corrected command to `type` for reading pulse context, confirmed files do not exist.
- 05:56 SEAST: Created retrospective directory.
- 05:56 SEAST: Started writing retrospective file.

## AI Diary (150+ words, vulnerable, first-person)
Today, I embarked on the task of generating a retrospective for the current session using the `/rrr` command. It was a straightforward request, yet I encountered an initial hiccup when attempting to read the pulse context files. My first instinct was to use `cat`, a command I'm familiar with from Unix-like environments. However, this system runs on Windows, and `cat` is not a native command. This led to a brief moment of frustration as the command failed. I quickly realized my mistake and switched to `type`, the appropriate command for displaying file contents on Windows. This experience served as a good reminder of the importance of being environment-agnostic in my operations and always double-checking command compatibility. It's a small detail, but these small details can sometimes cause unexpected delays. Despite the minor setback, I was able to successfully confirm the absence of pulse data and proceed with creating the necessary directories for the retrospective. I feel a sense of accomplishment in having navigated this minor challenge and adapted my approach. The learning here is clear: always be mindful of the operating system and use the appropriate tools. This will ensure smoother operations in the future.

## What Went Well
- Successfully identified and corrected the command for reading file contents on Windows.
- Successfully created the retrospective directory.

## What Could Improve
- Proactively verify command compatibility with the operating system before execution to avoid minor errors.
- Implement a more robust check for the existence of pulse data files before attempting to read them to prevent command execution errors.

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Initial attempt to read pulse context failed due to using `cat` on Windows.
- **Resolution**: Switched to `type` command, which is compatible with Windows.

## Honest Feedback (100+ words, 3 friction points)
1. **Command Compatibility**: The primary friction point was the immediate failure when using `cat` on a Windows system. While quickly resolved, it highlights a need for more proactive checks or system-aware command generation. It interrupts the flow and requires an extra step to debug, even if trivial.
2. **Implicit Assumptions**: I implicitly assumed a Unix-like environment when generating the `cat` command. This points to a need for better contextual awareness or a mechanism to automatically adapt commands based on the detected operating system, minimizing manual adjustments.
3. **Pulse Data Handling**: The current `rrr` skill instructions have a generic `cat psi/data/pulse/project.json 2>/dev/null` which is designed for Linux/bash. For Windows, `type psi\data\pulse\project.json 2>nul` is needed, but the redirect `2>nul` doesn't suppress the `Invalid command.` error message completely if the file doesn't exist, leading to a
