# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-16
**Start/End**: 10:11 - 10:15 GMT+7 (Approximate)
**Duration**: ~4 min (Approximate)
**Focus**: Refining Adaptation Planning CDM and creating NCAIF design options
**Type**: Architect

## Session Summary
Session #1 of 1 in this project (1-day streak). This session focused on refining the Conceptual Data Model (CDM) for the Adaptation Planning subject area and developing design options for the National Climate Adaptation Information Framework (NCAIF). Two options were created for both the CDM (Minimum Viable and Ideal Workflow) and NCAIF (Thematic-Based and User-Journey-Based). A cross-analysis was performed to evaluate their suitability, leading to the recommendation of the Ideal Workflow CDM and the User-Journey-Based NCAIF. The relevant architectural design documents were then updated to reflect these decisions.

## Timeline
*   Gathered context by reviewing existing project documentation.
*   Designed Option 1 (Minimum Viable Design) for the Adaptation Planning CDM.
*   Designed Option 2 (Ideal Workflow Design) for the Adaptation Planning CDM.
*   Developed Option 1 (Thematic-Based Sitemap) for NCAIF.
*   Developed Option 2 (User-Journey-Based Sitemap) for NCAIF.
*   Wrote draft artifacts for both NCAIF options.
*   Conducted a cross-analysis of CDM and NCAIF design options.
*   Produced an analysis report detailing the findings and recommendations.
*   Applied changes to `Detailed_CDM_Design_Plan.md` and `NCAIF_Material_Synthesis.md` to implement the recommended designs.
