# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-10
**Start/End**: 13:11 - 13:35 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~24 min
**Focus**: CDM Expansion for CRDB (Adaptation, Activity, Knowledge domains)
**Type**: Research | Architecture Decisions

## Session Summary
Expanded the Conceptual Data Model (CDM) for the CRDB project (Session #45 of 92 in this project, 2-day streak). Integrated international benchmarking (A-PLAT, KLiVO, Climate-ADAPT) and DCCE internal product requirements (SAR, Eco-School) into a "System of Systems" architecture.

## Timeline
- **13:11**: Initial context gathering from T-PLAT analysis and benchmarking learnings.
- **13:18**: Deep dive into the CRDB Inception Report to verify TOR alignment.
- **13:21**: Browser-based review of international adaptation frameworks (EU/Germany/Japan).
- **13:22**: Strategic expansion of the CDM into three new domains: Adaptation & Response, Activity & Audit, and Knowledge & Content.
- **13:23**: Refined `EXPOSED_ASSET` to harmonize with TGEIS (GHG) activity data requirements.
- **13:24**: Final synthesis and CDM update.

## Files Modified
- [`01_Projects/2025-11_DCCE-CRDB/task/Conceptual Data Model for climate risk and adaptation data system.md`](01_Projects/2025-11_DCCE-CRDB/task/Conceptual Data Model for climate risk and adaptation data system.md)

## Key Code Changes
- Added Mermaid ERD for expanded domains.
- Implemented the "Management Tracking" pattern to solve for "orphaned" DCCE products.
- Established semantic tagging for qualitative knowledge assets.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Bridge over Library**: Shifted the CDM from a "Risk-First" model to a "Solution-First" model by elevating `ADAPTATION_PROJECT` as a first-class entity.
- **Synergy over Silo**: Forced the `EXPOSED_ASSET` entity to adopt TGEIS attributes, ensuring the database serves both Adaptation and Mitigation divisions simultaneously.

## AI Diary (150+ words, vulnerable, first-person)
Today felt like a significant leap forward in bridge-building between "pure science" and "organizational reality." Usually, data models focus on the elegant math of risk ($R = H \times E \times V$), but the CRDB project demanded more: it needed a home for the human side of climate action. Diving into the T-PLAT shortfalls highlighted how "portal" architecture fails if it doesn't treat qualitative knowledge as structured data. I felt a sense of clarity when I realized that `ADAPTATION_INTERVENTION` couldn't just be a shallow flag; it needed to be an instantiated project with a funding source and a CBA ratio to be "actionable" for a policymaker. The "orphaned" products like Eco-School and SAR were particularly satisfying to solve—by introducing the `MANAGEMENT_PROGRAM` entity, I've enabled the DCCE to finally ask spatial questions about their administrative outreach. There's a subtle tension in trying to make a model that's "one size fits all" (like the TGEIS livestock alignment), but it's the only way to avoid the data-reporting fatigue that kills these systems in the long run. I'm moving with high velocity now, feeling the momentum of an unbroken streak where each session builds directly on the synthesis of the last.

## What Went Well
- Seamless integration of international benchmarks into the local CDM.
- Successful identification of inter-departmental synergies (GHG alignment).
- Quick reconstruction of the "Knowledge" domain from T-PLAT's qualitative needs.

## What Could Improve
- PDF-to-text extraction remains "noisy," requiring more manual verification of table structures.
- Sequential browser actions for Notion scrolling added minor latency to the research phase.

## Honest Feedback (100+ words, 3 friction points)
1. **PDF Extraction Quality**: The inception report text dump lost significant structural context (tables/figures), which forced a reliance on text-only inference for some TOR clauses.
2. **Context Latency**: Waiting for browser screenshots and logs during the Notion review phase created a "stop-and-go" rhythm that slightly broke the architectural flow. 
3. **Cross-Platform CLI**: I initially tripped on the `date` vs `powershell` syntax for timestamp gathering, highlighting a minor friction point in the Windows-hosted environment. Despite these, the overall synthesis was robust.

## Lessons Learned
- **Semantic Density is Actionable**: A database that can link an infographic to a specific return-period flood event is exponentially more valuable than a PDF repository.
- **Harmonization as Governance**: Solving the "double-reporting" issue for provinces by aligning Asset attributes with GHG standards is a powerful non-technical driver for database adoption.

## Next Steps
- Develop the **Logical Data Model (LDM)** for the "Activity & Audit" domain.
- Map specific DCCE division data schemas to the new `MANAGEMENT_PROGRAM` entities.
