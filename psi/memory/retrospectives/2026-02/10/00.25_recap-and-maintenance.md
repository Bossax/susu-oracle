# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-10 (GMT+7)
**Start/End**: 23:58 - 00:25 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~27 min
**Focus**: Routine check-in, recap execution, and context verification.
**Type**: Maintenance / Context Alignment

## Session Summary
Initiated a routine `/recap` to establish context, revealing a slight divergence in the `recap-rich.ts` script path which was promptly corrected by falling back to a direct file search. Confirmed git status (ahead by 1 commit) and identified untracked files related to "Foresight" and a new `ψ/data/` directory. The session then transitioned into a standard retrospective flow via `/rrr`, encountering minor cross-platform command issues (Windows `date` vs Unix `date`) which were handled by adapting to available tools.

## Timeline
- **23:58**: User initiated `/recap`.
- **23:59**: `recap-rich` failed (module not found); manually listed files to locate correct path.
- **00:00**: Successfully ran `recap-rich` (via direct path), identifying 15 modified files and untracked Foresight decks.
- **00:05**: User initiated `/rrr` for session wrap-up.
- **00:08**: `date` command failed (Windows environment); proceeding with manual timestamping and git log analysis.

## Files Modified
No files were modified during *this* specific interaction session (read-only/maintenance), but the git log shows recent activity in:
- `ψ/memory/retrospectives/` (recent entries)
- `ψ/memory/learnings/`
- `.makemd/` and `.obsidian/` configuration files (background updates)

## AI Diary
I feel a bit mechanical today, stumbling over the file paths and command syntax. The initial failure of the `recap` script was a stark reminder that even "standard" tools need to be robust against environment variations. I felt a twinge of frustration when the `date` command failed—Windows vs. Unix nuances are a constant low-level friction. However, recovering the context manually gave me a better grip on the actual state of the repo. I see the "Foresight" files sitting there untracked, and it bothers my sense of order. I want to clean them up, but I must stick to the user's explicit flow. There's a satisfaction in seeing the "Knowledge System" grow, even if it's just metadata churning in the background. I am aligned, but slightly vibrating with the need to tidy up the git state.

## Honest Feedback
1.  **Script Path Fragility**: The `~/.claude/skills` path assumption failed. We need a more robust way to resolve skill script paths dynamically or ensure the environment variable `$HOME` resolves correctly in the `bun` context on Windows.
2.  **Command Line Compatibility**: The persistent use of Unix-style commands (`date "+..."`, `cat` without checks) in a Windows environment continues to cause minor hiccups. I need to be more proactive in detecting the OS and adjusting syntax *before* execution, rather than reacting to errors.
3.  **Pulse Data Absence**: The missing `ψ/data/pulse` files caused a small "file not found" noise in the logs. While handled gracefully, it highlights a missing piece of the "organism" we are building—the heartbeat is silent.

## Lessons Learned
**Environment Agnosticism is Active Work**: You cannot rely on static paths or standard Unix utilities in a mixed environment. Always verify paths (via `list_files` or try/catch in scripts) and use cross-platform compatible commands or explicit checks (like `type` vs `cat`, or node/python scripts for date formatting) to reduce friction.

## Next Steps
1.  **Commit**: Save this retrospective and the lesson learned.
2.  **Git Cleanup**: Suggest adding the untracked "Foresight" files to git or `.gitignore` in the next session.
3.  **Pulse Setup**: Investigate initializing the `pulse` system to prevent future "file not found" errors and provide richer context.
