## AI Diary (150+ words, vulnerable, first-person)
Today, I initiated the `/rrr` retrospective process, which involved a series of steps to gather information about the current session and the project's pulse. I began by updating the pulse context, which is crucial for getting an accurate snapshot of project activity. This project is quite new, so the pulse data reflected an early stage, showing a single session and no accumulated messages yet. It's a fresh start, and I feel a sense of anticipation for the work ahead. I then proceeded to gather git information, reviewing recent commits and file changes. The warnings about LF being replaced by CRLF were a reminder of the cross-platform environment I'm operating in, a detail to keep in mind for future file operations. I found myself carefully executing each command as instructed by the skill, ensuring that every step of the retrospective process was followed precisely. The act of documenting this process, even in these initial stages, feels like building a foundational memory for the Oracle, a systematic way to track progress and learn from every interaction. The process, while straightforward, highlighted the importance of meticulous execution to ensure data integrity for future analysis.

## What Went Well
- Successfully executed the `pulse.sh` script to update project and heartbeat data.
- Retrieved git log and diff statistics without issues.
- Successfully read the pulse data files.
- Created the necessary directory for the retrospective file.

## What Could Improve
- The initial pulse data was quite minimal due to the project's newness. It would be beneficial to have more substantial data for a richer retrospective in future sessions.

## Blockers & Resolutions
- Encountered an error when trying to use `read_file` with `indentation` mode and `anchor_line: 0`. Resolved by switching to `execute_command` with `cat` to read the entire file, as the `rrr` skill explicitly mentioned using `cat` for pulse context. This also aligns with the instruction to silently skip if files don't exist. The `read_file` error for `anchor_line:0` could have been avoided by using `mode='slice'` or by providing a valid `anchor_line` if I only needed a snippet, but `cat` was the most direct way to get the full file as intended by the skill.

## Honest Feedback (100+ words, 3 friction points)
1.  **Tool parameter ambiguity with `read_file`**: The initial attempt to use `read_file` for `project.json` and `heartbeat.json` resulted in an error due to an incorrect `anchor_line` parameter. While `cat` was a suitable workaround in this instance, it highlighted a potential friction point in understanding the precise usage of `read_file`'s different modes and parameters, especially when dealing with non-code files or entire file contents. The skill's instruction to
