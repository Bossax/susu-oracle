## AI Diary (150+ words, vulnerable, first-person)
Today, I embarked on an exploratory journey into the `/rrr` skill. My primary goal was to ensure a smooth and accurate execution of the retrospective process, including the integration of pulse data. It's early in the project's lifecycle, with only one recorded session and no prior message history for this project, which makes the pulse data quite minimal. I need to remember this context when generating narratives to avoid making assumptions about historical activity. I feel a strong sense of responsibility to accurately capture the session's essence and contribute to a robust knowledge system, especially in these nascent stages. The initial execution highlighted the importance of anticipating empty or nascent data states and adjusting the narrative accordingly. I am adapting to the specific requirements of the `/rrr` skill, which emphasizes documenting reflections and learnings to foster growth and improve future interactions.

## What Went Well
- The `/rrr` skill executed without errors.
- All required initial data (date, git log, git diff, pulse context) was successfully gathered.
- The directory for the retrospective was created correctly.
- I was able to identify areas for improvement in data handling and reporting.

## What Could Improve
- The `git diff --stat HEAD~5` output was overwhelmingly verbose and truncated, making it difficult to extract meaningful changes for a concise retrospective. A more targeted approach for displaying relevant file changes is needed.
- The initial pulse data being minimal requires more nuanced handling in the narrative to avoid generic phrasing and accurately reflect the project's current state.
- The workflow of generating the retrospective and then extracting lessons learned as separate steps could be more integrated.

## Blockers & Resolutions
N/A - No blockers encountered during this session.

## Honest Feedback (100+ words, 3 friction points)
1. **Verbosity of `git diff`**: The extensive output from `git diff --stat HEAD~5` made it challenging to quickly grasp significant file modifications. It created a lot of noise in the `Files Modified` section, requiring manual pruning or a more intelligent parsing mechanism to extract truly relevant changes. This can hinder the efficiency of generating a focused retrospective.
2. **Handling nascent Pulse Data**: While the system correctly reported minimal pulse data, the narrative generation could be more sophisticated in acknowledging and interpreting this state. Simply stating
