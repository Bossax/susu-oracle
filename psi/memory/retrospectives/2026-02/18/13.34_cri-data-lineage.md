# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-18  
**Start/End**: ~13:00 - 13:34 GMT+7  
**Duration**: ~35 min  
**Focus**: Correcting CRI Phase 1 & Pilot data lineage and updating project status docs  
**Type**: Documentation & Methodology Refinement

## Session Summary

This session focused on aligning the Climate Risk Index (CRI) documentation with the clarified data lineage from TEI. I updated the Working Status Brief and Implementation Plan to reflect the SES-based pivot and the Fiscal Relief framing, then corrected the Phase 1 and Pilot methodologies so they no longer imply the use of DDPM monetary damage data or agricultural-only GPP. The economic pillar is now consistently described as a Fiscal Relief Index using OAE compensation data and total provincial GPP, with explicit acknowledgement of bias and data gaps.

## Timeline

- Reviewed updated meeting note from 2026-02-04 (Creagy–TEI) on CRI data lineage.  
- Re-read CRI Phase 1 and Phase 2 methodology files and the Pilot methodology source note.  
- Updated the Working Status Brief to reflect SES pivot, Fiscal Relief emphasis, and near-term priorities.  
- Bumped Implementation Plan version and aligned change log and narrative with the new framing.  
- Corrected Phase 1 methodology to clarify OAE-only relief data and total GPP denominator.  
- Corrected Pilot methodology source table and notes to distinguish conceptual vs actually used variables and match TEI’s clarifications.

## AI Diary

I spent this session untangling the hidden assumptions in the CRI data pipeline. The TEI meeting note made it very clear that some of my earlier interpretations were subtly off: there is no operational DDPM monetary damage series in the pilot index, and the relief data that does exist is purely agricultural compensation from OAE, normalised by total provincial GPP because sectoral GPP splits are not yet available for all years. Writing that nuance down in a way that future-me and collaborators will actually trust required being brutally honest about the gaps and biases.

It felt satisfying to replace vague phrases like “disaster relief payments” with precise statements about OAE compensation, capped area rules and the practical meaning of zeros in the dataset. There is always a temptation to over-claim what an index measures; here the right move was to narrow the claim and sharpen the explanation. The SES pivot in Phase 2 also became clearer: the Impact Index is about fiscal strain, while the Capacity Profiles are about structures and processes. Together they now read like a coherent design rather than a pile of loosely related ideas.

## Honest Feedback

1. The original documentation mixed conceptual intent and actual data usage in the same tables, which made it too easy to misunderstand what was really in the spreadsheet. Separating “intended variables” from “variables actually used” took time but should have been part of the first write-up.  
2. The GPP denominator issue (total vs agricultural) is a good example of how a small technical ambiguity can have large interpretive consequences. It took a full pass through the TEI note and the Excel audit to be confident enough to rewrite this, which suggests the initial audit was not documented rigorously enough.  
3. The workflow around project retrospectives and learnings is still fairly manual; there is no automatic pulse context or commit integration here, so it relies on discipline rather than tooling to ensure these reflections are captured consistently.

## Lessons Learned

- Data lineage must distinguish clearly between **conceptual design** and **actual implemented variables**; otherwise indices invite over-interpretation.  
- When sectoral splits (e.g. agricultural vs non-agricultural GPP) are unavailable, using total GPP is acceptable only if the bias is explicitly acknowledged and treated as a temporary workaround.  
- TEI’s clarifications on “0 = no report” should be treated as first-class logic in the methodology, not a footnote; this justifies the Administrative Gap Flag as a core design element.  
- The SES pivot (Impact via Fiscal Relief + Capacity via Coping/Adaptive/Transformative) reads much more coherently once the economic pillar is grounded in real data constraints.

## Next Steps

- Use the corrected Phase 1 and Pilot methodology documents as the reference when building data pipelines and notebooks for the Fiscal Relief Index.  
- Implement the Administrative Gap Flag logic directly in code, following the clarified 0 vs missing semantics.  
- Prepare consultation-ready visuals that illustrate the difference between Impact (Fiscal Relief), Capacity Profiles and Administrative Gaps.  
- Revisit GPP denominators once sectoral GPP data is available, and plan for a versioned methodology update when that transition occurs.
