# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-11
**Start/End**: 09:23 - 10:05 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~42 min
**Focus**: Refine NCAIF Sitemap and Conceptual Data Model, addressing comments and documenting data asset integration.
**Type**: Refactoring, Documentation

## Session Summary
This session involved iterative refinement of the [National Climate Adaptation Information Framework (NCAIF) Sitemap](01_Projects/2025-11_DCCE-CRDB/task/National%20Climate%20Adaptation%20Information%20Framework.md) and the [Conceptual Data Model (CDM)](01_Projects/2025-11_DCCE-CRDB/task/Conceptual%20Data%20Model%20for%20climate%20risk%20and%20adaptation%20data%20system.md). I addressed several comments regarding the clarity and depth of documentation, particularly concerning the value proposition of hazardous events, the role of `RESILIENCE_ASSESSMENT`, and the strategy for managing case study content. Additionally, I added a comprehensive section to the NCAIF Sitemap document detailing how various data assets and knowledge products defined in the [CRDB - Implementation Plan.md](01_Projects/2025-11_DCCE-CRDB/output/CRDB%20-%20Implementation%20Plan.md) integrate with the sitemap and CDM. The `CRDB - Work Status Brief.md` was also updated to reflect the next three key issues for NCAIF and CDM refinement. The project is still in its early stages as indicated by the pulse context, with zero sessions and commits recorded, but this session marks significant progress in refining the core architectural documents.

## Timeline
- **09:23:** Started by reviewing the initial request and files (`Conceptual Data Model for climate risk and adaptation data system.md`, `Fitting CRI phase 2 into the CDM.md`).
- **09:23:** Updated the todo list to reflect the initial analysis steps.
- **09:23:** Read the contents of `Conceptual Data Model for climate risk and adaptation data system.md` and `Fitting CRI phase 2 into the CDM.md`.
- **09:23:** Confirmed that no changes were needed to the CDM structure based on the CRI Phase 2 analysis.
- **09:23:** Formulated a response to the user regarding the CDM's robustness.
- **09:24:** Added a new section,
