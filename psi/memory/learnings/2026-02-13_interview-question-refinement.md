# Lesson Learned: Efficient Interview Question Refinement

**Date**: 2026-02-13

**Lesson**: When refining existing documents, especially interview questions, leveraging detailed context files and the `apply_diff` tool proves highly efficient. By pre-analyzing the specific needs and current activities of each stakeholder from their respective detail markdown files, I can directly inject targeted, relevant questions into the main interview document. This approach minimizes extraneous edits, ensures accuracy, and directly addresses the core information requirements for the project. The `apply_diff` tool's precision allows for surgical updates, preventing unintended changes and maintaining document integrity.

**Context**: During the DCCE-CRDB project, the task involved refining interview questions for the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, the Federation of Thai Industries, and the Thai Bankers' Association. Each organization had a corresponding detailed context file. Instead of rewriting entire sections, I utilized the insights from these context files to enhance and refine specific questions within the existing interview documents.
