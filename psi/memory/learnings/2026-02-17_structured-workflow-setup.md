Establishing a clear, structured workflow for consultancy sessions, encompassing explicit planning (objectives, hypotheses, tasks, expected outcomes), execution with atomic commits and feature branches, and comprehensive retrospectives, is crucial for enhancing focus, improving strategic reasoning documentation, and creating a transparent audit trail of decisions and actions. This approach empowers the human consultant to leverage their unique skills in contextual understanding and strategic vision more effectively, while the AI supports by automating tasks and maintaining historical context.
