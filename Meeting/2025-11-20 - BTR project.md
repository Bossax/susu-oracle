Toey starts with [[Sources/Spatial climate risk map DCCE v2|Spatial climate risk map DCCE v2]]
- normalized risk index
- ranking

Limitation [[Limitations of DCCE Spatial risk map]]
- cannot be used by local planners

Ideas: another tool spatial risk
- more granular
- down to sub-provincial level
- DCCE wants a map that reflects the information about historical risk map 
	- hazard extent
	- exposure
		- settlement
		- community
		- agricultural land
	- granular enough for ทศจ to understand risk
- need to give the sense of "climatology" long term trends
- This map's standpoint is collecting all climate-related risks. 

What datasets can be used for this purpose
What needs to be requested in addition

**Scope** (by Toey)
- Focus on historical - budget constraints and set up the structure for future development
- Probabilistic approach is not yet to be done in this project

ADPC:
DDPM has a record of hazard occurrence 

RID HII has flood data in watersheds

GISTDA - satellite data
DDPM - local staff reporting. not spatial

(Toey) Should be official data?
- Not index yet.
- Want to see spatial data of hazards

Ok develop hazard data granularity

(Meiji) Can we add wildfire?

Hazards 5+1
- flood
- landslide
- drought
- tropical storm
- extreme temperature
- + wildfire

**Existing datasets**

RU-CORE has shapefiles
- [ ] ADPC shall identify key exposure datasets
- [ ] ADPC shall check the sea level data

(Toey) - most datasets are available in tabular format. A few are in shapefiles.

# ADPC datasets
- Drought maps are done by many agencies
- ADPC's  composite drought index
	- met  (SPI) + agri (NVDI) drought
