2.       Drought

3.       Heat

4.       Storm

5.       Sea Level Rise (optional)

·         Exposure datasets must be official (from relevant authorities). No derived datasets unless validated.

·         ADPC will list the essential/important exposure items required for risk analysis.

### 2.2 Webmap Functional Requirements
