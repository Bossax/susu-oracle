# Statistical downscaling

ML: Random forest architecture
Data sources: reanalysis datasets 
Principle: GCM preservation (**avoid overfitting**)
Limitation: ML model cannot capture small scale dynamical changes that might change the governing equations

extreme statistics are also available


# Dynamical downscaling 
Earth System Model
- atmosphere
- land surface
- cryosphere
- heat transfer

GCM's output as initial and boundary conditions

**CORDEX-SEA**
- vet GCMs and RCMs and rank them
- Region 14: SEA can reproduce monsoons

**SSP selection**
1. ~~SSP1 -2.6~~
2. SSP2 -4.5 <2 degree C
3. SSP5 -8.5 ~ 4 degree C

Bias in precipitation predictions always exists
Relative humidity is a function of temperature (denominator)
- calculation of water vapor (absolute humidity)
- then divided by a function of temperature 
- The trend is decreasing

**Extreme Indices**
DTR Tmax - Tmin is decreasing (temperatures shift higher )
CWD 
R20mm (days)

**Distribution platform**
another project
use cases focus on NAP sectors


Statistical downscaling is for trend analysis
Dynamical downscaling preserves physical rules
