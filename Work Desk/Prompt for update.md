# Task 1: update the project implementation plan

Inputs:
1. Implementation plan
2. Ancillary material
	1. meeting notes
	2. idea notes

Step 1 — Extract insight

- List all explicit decisions, new tasks, deadline changes, scope clarifications, risks, and assumptions from the meeting.
    
- For each item, tag:
    
    - Related Work Package (1–6), activity or deliverable (e.g., “Data landscape & gap report,” “NCAIF artifact,” “Spreadsheet Data Catalog,” “Evaluation & roadmap”).
    - Time window (month/year or week if mentioned).
    - Type: [Decision] / [Action] / [Risk] / [Dependency] / [Open question].
        

Step 2 — Multi-angle impact assessment  
For each item, analyse impact from these angles:
- Schedule: what dates or months in the master plan should shift (start/end of activities, due dates).​
- Scope & deliverables: what deliverables or activities need to be added, removed, or reworded, within the existing TOR scope.​
- Dependencies: which WPs or tasks upstream/downstream are affected (e.g., WP2 interviews delaying WP3 ontology refinement or WP4 catalog build).​
- Risks & assumptions: which risks should be added or updated in the plan (e.g., data availability, stakeholder availability, institutional decisions).​
    

Step 3 — Propose concrete plan changes (no auto-edit)

- Produce a CHANGE LOG table: one row per change with columns:
    - ID, WP, Plan section (e.g., “WP2 – Key activities & timeline”), Current text (short paraphrase), Proposed update (short paraphrase), Rationale (1–2 lines), Needs sponsor confirmation? [Yes/No].
        
- For rows where changes are clear, draft revised text snippets I can paste into the plan, preserving tone and structure. Focus on:
    - Activity descriptions and timelines under each WP.
    - Deliverable descriptions (e.g., reports, artifacts, workshops).​
    - Summary timeline table (Nov 2025–Aug 2026) where needed.​

# Task 2: update the Working Status Brief

maintain a single “Working Status Brief” for this project.  
It must be short enough to read in under 5 minutes and focus only on what I need to remember immediately before an update meeting.

Inputs:
1. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.
2. MEETING NOTES
3. Ancillary material
	1. meeting notes
	2. idea notes
    

Please do the following:
1. Infer the project’s current overall health and key priority for roughly the next 2–4 weeks.
2. Identify the 3–5 most important active work streams or work packages, and what must be done soon for each.
3. Extract only the most consequential recent decisions and assumptions that affect scope, timing, or dependencies.
4. Preserve the previous points that are not stated as resolved or completed
5. List the next 3–5 upcoming milestones or deadlines (by date or month), and flag any that look at risk based on the latest notes.
6. Identify up to 3 short‑term risks or “watchpoints” that I should keep in mind before speaking with the sponsor.
    
7. Draft a short sponsor message (max 5 bullet points) I could use in my next update call or email.
    

Output format (overwrite the old brief):
- **1. Current project health & priority**  
    2–3 sentences.
- **2. Near‑term focus (next 2–4 weeks)**  
    Numbered list of up to 5 items, one sentence each.
- **3. Key decisions & assumptions to remember**  
    Bulleted list, max 6 bullets, one sentence each.
- **4. Imminent milestones & deadlines**  
    List of 3–5 dated items. Indicate [At risk] where relevant.
- **5. Short‑term risks & watchpoints**  
    Up to 3 bullets, one sentence each.
- **6. Next sponsor/steering message**  
    Up to 5 bullets: progress, issues, decisions needed.

Use concise, plain language. Do not restate the whole implementation plan—only what is essential for me to have “front of mind” 10 minutes before a meeting.
