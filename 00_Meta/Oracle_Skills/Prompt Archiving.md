# Note Archiving Protocol

**Rules:**

2. look for a file `Archived_Notes_Summary` in `output` folder of a project, create one if does not exist using 'artifact' template in @/00_Meta/template
3. update the summary note by adding new section of the notes being archived
4. preserve the previous content 
5. When done summarizing, move the files to `99_Archive/`
